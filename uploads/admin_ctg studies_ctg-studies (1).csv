NCT07052812,Exploring The Metacognitive Beliefs in OCD: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Metacognitive Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052812,MCT-OCD,COMPLETED,"Exploring The Metacognitive Beliefs in OCD: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Metacognitive Therapy Introduction Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These symptoms cause significant distress and impair daily functioning. OCD can be difficult to treat, and relapse rates are high even after conventional treatments. This study evaluates whether Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is more effective than Treatment as Usual (TAU) in reducing OCD symptoms and improving overall well-being. The study explores how MCT, which targets metacognitive beliefs (thoughts about thoughts), can help manage symptoms more effectively than standard treatments.

Study Goal and Research Question

The primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) for treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The key research question is:

Does Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) reduce OCD symptoms more effectively than Treatment as Usual (TAU)? Study Design

This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), which means participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:

Metacognitive Therapy (MCT): Participants in this group receive a 12-session therapy program that focuses on addressing harmful metacognitive beliefs, such as the need to control thoughts and the belief that thoughts can cause harm.

Treatment as Usual (TAU): Participants in this group receive the standard treatment for OCD, which may include Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) and/or medication.

Who Can Participate? Adults aged 18 and older who have been diagnosed with OCD are eligible to participate in the study. To be eligible, participants must have moderate to severe OCD symptoms, measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Individuals with severe mental health conditions other than OCD, such as psychosis or substance use disorders, are excluded from participation. Participants must also be able to attend therapy sessions and complete the necessary assessments throughout the study.

How the Study Was Conducted Randomization: Participants were randomly assigned to either the MCT group or the TAU group.

MCT Group: Participants in the MCT group attended 12 therapy sessions, which focused on changing metacognitive beliefs that contribute to OCD symptoms.

TAU Group: Participants in the TAU group received standard treatment for OCD, which may have included a combination of therapy and medications.

Assessments: Participants were assessed at three time points: before treatment (pre-treatment), immediately after treatment (post-treatment), and six months after treatment (follow-up). These assessments measured changes in OCD symptoms, metacognitive beliefs, and overall quality of life.

Study Procedures and Timeline Pre-Treatment Assessment: Participants completed initial assessments to measure their OCD symptoms, metacognitive beliefs, and quality of life.

Therapy Sessions: Participants in both groups attended their respective therapy sessions (12 sessions for MCT, standard sessions for TAU).

Post-Treatment and Follow-Up Assessments: After the therapy ended, participants completed post-treatment assessments. Six months later, they participated in a follow-up assessment to measure the long-term effectiveness of the treatment.

Important Information for Participants Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is designed to help people change the way they think about their thoughts, addressing beliefs such as the need to control thoughts or the belief that having certain thoughts can cause harm.

Treatment as Usual (TAU) is the standard treatment for OCD, which may include Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy or medication management.

Participants in this study can withdraw at any time, and their decision will not affect their treatment or relationship with their healthcare provider.

Expected Benefits If MCT is found to be more effective than TAU, it may offer a new, personalized approach to treating OCD, especially for individuals whose symptoms are driven by dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs. Additionally, since MCT targets the underlying thought processes that maintain OCD symptoms, it may provide longer-lasting symptom relief and reduce the likelihood of relapse compared to standard treatments.

Study Impact This study will provide important insights into whether MCT can provide better outcomes for individuals with OCD compared to standard treatments. If MCT is shown to be effective, it could become a valuable treatment option for those who do not respond well to traditional therapies like ERP. Moreover, MCT's focus on addressing metacognitive beliefs may lead to more durable improvements in OCD symptoms.",NO,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD),BEHAVIORAL: MCT,"Change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score, The Y-BOCS is a 10-item clinician-rated scale (scores 0-40) measuring OCD symptom severity.

The prevalence of aspirin uses increases with age as well as co-morbid vascular diseases. Patients with cardiovascular diseases are at risk of developing colorectal neoplasms. In patients undergoing screening colonoscopy, interruption of aspirin is believed to be associated with increased cardiovascular events. Continuation of aspirin can however be associated with an increased risk of post-polypectomy bleeding. International guidelines on periendoscopy management recommend the continuation of aspirin based on evidence from cohort studies, mostly retrospective, suggesting that the rate of bleeding is low. Cardiovascular complications from aspirin interruption can lead to disabilities and occasional deaths. The cardiovascular risks following aspirin continuation or interruption in endoscopy have not been well studied. There has been no randomized study to compare either strategy.

It supports the practice of clustered care, which refers to grouping routine medical and nursing procedures into a single care time period to reduce handling and allow the infant uninterrupted rest and maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle.

This study aims to develop a clustered care practice guideline and evaluate its effectiveness. The study was designed as a single-blind randomized controlled trial, where the participating nurses will not be informed about their group allocation (intervention or control) to reduce bias.The study will be conducted between July and September 2025 in the level 2 and 3 NICUs of Necmettin Erbakan University Faculty of Medicine Hospital in Konya, Turkey.

The study population includes all 44 nurses working in these NICUs who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate. Since the entire population is accessible, total population sampling will be used. After data collection is completed, a post hoc power analysis will be conducted using G\*Power (v3.1.9.2).

Data will be collected using the ""Descriptive Information Form for the Infant and the Nurse"" and the ""Clustered Care Practice Guideline"". Pre-test data will be collected before training, and post-test data will be collected 4-6 weeks after the training.

The intervention group will receive the Clustered Care Practice Training Based on Individualized Developmental Care in two in-person sessions (approx. 45 minutes per session), delivered in small groups (11-12 participants). A training booklet prepared by the researchers will be distributed at the end of the sessions.

NCT07052747,Periodontal Effects of Orthodontic Mini-Screws,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052747,,COMPLETED,"Orthodontic mini-screws (TADs) are commonly used to provide temporary anchorage and prevent unwanted tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. Their clinical success largely depends on their ability to remain stable under functional orthodontic loads. Stability is assessed in two phases: primary stability, which reflects immediate mechanical retention in bone, and secondary stability, which results from biological remodeling and healing over time. Multiple factors such as age, gender, bone characteristics, screw dimensions, and force magnitude may influence screw stability.

Recent studies suggest that local inflammation around mini-screws, similar to peri-implantitis in dental implants, can compromise bone integrity and lead to screw failure. Inadequate oral hygiene and the absence of keratinized tissue at the insertion site are among the key risk factors associated with inflammation and soft tissue complications. Unlike traditional implants, mini-screws are often inserted at variable intraoral locations and subject to angular force vectors, which may further impact surrounding periodontal tissues.

This cross-sectional clinical study aims to evaluate the effects of orthodontic mini-screw placement on general oral health and periodontal tissue status.

NCT07052721,Randomized Study of an Analgesic Device Enabling Local Anesthetic Delivery and Neuromodulation After Shoulder/Foot Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052721,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Postoperative pain remains undertreated with inadequate analgesic options. Opioids have well-known limitations for both individuals and society; single-injection and continuous peripheral nerve blocks provide intense analgesia but are limited in duration to 24-72 hours; and current neuromodulation options-with a duration measured in weeks and not hours-are prohibitively expensive and require an additional procedure. One possible solution is a device currently under investigation to treat postoperative pain. The RELAY system (Gate Science, Moultonborough, New Hampshire) is comprised of a basic catheter-over-needle device to allow administration of a single-injection of local anesthetic via the needle (or catheter) followed by a perineural local anesthetic infusion via the remaining catheter (when desired). Subsequent to the local anesthetic administration, instead of removing the catheter as with all previous continuous peripheral nerve block equipment, electric current may be delivered via the same catheter and an integrated pulse generator for up to 28 days. This is potentially revolutionary because it would allow an anesthesiologist to deliver (1) a single-injection peripheral nerve block; (2) a continuous peripheral nerve block; and (3) neuromodulation using a single device that can theoretically be placed in the same amount of time required for a single-injection peripheral nerve block. Instead of providing fewer than 24 hours of postoperative analgesia, up to 28 days of pain control could be delivered without disruption of existing practice patterns. The ultimate objective of the proposed investigation is to investigate the post-operative analgesic potential of this investigational device and prepare for a pivotal multicenter clinical trial.

This feasibility study will be a series of participants all receiving both local anesthetic and electric current via a single device (RELAY, Gate Science, Moultonborough, New Hampshire).

Although evidence-based treatments such as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) are effective, they typically require weekly sessions over 6-9 months, which many adolescents struggle to complete. High dropout rates remain a significant clinical challenge.

Intensive trauma-focused interventions have shown promising outcomes in adults, including rapid symptom reduction and improved retention. Inspired by a Dutch model, this project evaluates a Swedish adaptation of Korte Intensieve Traumabehandeling (KIT), referred to as KIT-S, which combines EMDR, elements of TF-CBT, physical activity, and parental support in a 5-day intensive treatment.

This project is a pilot study to examine the feasibility, early effects, and practicality of intensive trauma-focused therapy. The pilot study is the first step toward planning a larger, controlled study in Swedish child and adolescent psychiatry.

The following questions are included in the project:

1. Is intensive trauma-focused psychological treatment with EMDR, components of TF-CBT, combined with physical activity and a parent group a feasible, suitable, and acceptable treatment method for PTSD within Swedish child and adolescent psychiatry in terms of:

   1. Therapists' ratings of whether they find the intensive trauma-focused treatment acceptable, appropriate, and feasible.
   2. The number of patients who complete the treatment without dropping out
   3. Patients' self-reported satisfaction with the treatment
   4. The proportion of patients with ""adverse effects""

CAR T-cell therapy has revolutionized modern cancer therapy, with Yescarta and Breyanzi (anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies) FDA approved for second- or later-line treatment of relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

IL-7 plays a crucial role in T-cell homeostasis by inducing thymic differentiation, peripheral expansion, and extrathymic differentiation. It is the main regulator of T-cell hemostasis, inducing T-cell growth and proliferation in lymphopenic patients. There is data that suggests that exposure of T-cells to IL-7 may expand T-cells, prevent T-cell exhaustion, and improve effector functions.

NT-I7 is a long-acting human IL-7 cytokine which has been shown in nonclinical studies to increase peripheral T-cells, antitumor efficacy, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, either as a monotherapy or in combination with chemo/radiotherapy and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T therapy.

This study is testing the hypothesis that the administration of NT-I7 following standard of care (SOC) approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies for subjects with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) will be safe and tolerable and may increase the expansion and persistence of CAR T-cells in vivo, which may result in increased tumor response rate and improved clinical outcomes.",NO,Large B-cell Lymphoma,DRUG: NT-17|BIOLOGICAL: CAR T-cell therapy,"Incidence of adverse events, Measured per CTCAE v 5.0.

NCT07052162,Investigating the Pharmacokinetics of Tafenoquine in Healthy Papua New Guinean Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052162,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread malaria species and the second largest contributor to symptomatic malaria worldwide. It accounts for half of all malaria cases outside Africa, with an estimated 14.3 million clinical vivax malaria cases reported annually, contributing to an annual cost of US$359 million. Children are most vulnerable to infection, with P. vivax prevalence peaking between 2 to 6 years of age. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), there are \>1.5 million suspected P. vivax cases annually, and while P. falciparum infections are the most prevalent, P. vivax transmission is the most intense in the world. P. vivax in PNG provides a unique epidemiological setting in which to assess innovative treatments in children.

The complex biology of P. vivax represents a challenge for malaria control and chemotherapy, especially dormant liver-stage parasites (hypnozoites) which can reactivate (relapse) and cause disease at a time remote from the primary infection. Hypnozoite relapse is the primary cause of vivax malaria in endemic regions and is resistant to most antimalarial drugs. Identifying effective treatments for radical cure, the complete elimination of parasites (both blood- and liver-stage), is therefore a priority. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a 14-day radical cure regimen for uncomplicated vivax malaria; comprised of blood stage treatment (chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)) and 14 days of the 8-aminoquinoline drug primaquine (PQ; 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/day) for liver-stage cure. More recently, the 8-aminoquinoline tafenoquine has garnered interest as an alternative radical cure agent to primaquine. However, there is limited data on the pharmacokinetics, tolerability and radical cure efficacy of tafenoquine in children.

NCT07052149,Stabilization vs Proprioception Training on Neck Flexor Endurance in Adolescents With Forward Head Posture,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052149,,RECRUITING,"Forward Head Posture (FHP) is a common postural deviation among adolescents, often resulting from prolonged screen use and poor ergonomic habits. It is characterized by an anterior positioning of the head relative to the vertical midline of the body, leading to altered cervical spine mechanics and muscle imbalances.

NCT07052084,Systematic Adjunction of Vasopressine in Septic Shock,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052084,SAVSepticShock,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Septic shock is a syndrome associated with severe infection and a mortality rate of approximately 45%. In line with current recommendations, norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor used in patients with septic shock. In a previous study, norepinephrine doses above 1 µg/kg/min were associated with mortality rates over 90%. In the same study, doses above 0.3 µg/kg/min were associated with a mortality rate of 40%. An increased mortality compared to the general 40% mortality of septic shock appears to be associated with norepinephrine doses as low as 0.3 µg/kg/min.

Vasopressin stimulates V1 receptors, primarily located on vascular smooth muscle cells. When V1a receptors are stimulated, they induce vasoconstriction by activating protein kinase C via a Gq protein and various second messengers.

Its use is validated in refractory shock states by international guidelines as a second-line vasopressor. This indication was further reinforced in the 2021 update of the septic shock management recommendations.

The VASST study, a randomized controlled trial, assessed the effects of vasopressin versus norepinephrine in septic shock. It found no overall difference in mortality between the two groups. However, in less severe cases where norepinephrine doses were below 14 µg/min before randomization, vasopressin was associated with significantly lower mortality, suggesting potential benefits from early introduction of a second vasopressor.

The VANISH trial failed to confirm this hypothesis, possibly due to broad inclusion criteria and unclear protocol regarding the combined use of both agents. Our hypothesis is that (1) vasopressin is beneficial when used synergistically with norepinephrine; (2) due to its negative effect on cardiac output (as shown in previous studies), vasopressin should only be administered to patients in the hyperdynamic phase of septic shock.

The hypothesis is that the systematic addition of vasopressin to norepinephrine therapy in a hyperdynamic septic shock subpopulation would improve patient outcomes.",NO,Septic Shock,DRUG: Experimental drug administration,"SOFA score comparison between the two groups, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment, 48 hours after administration of experimental drug (H48)","SOFA score comparison between the two groups, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment, 120 hours after administration of experimental drug (H120)|Mortality comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Lactatemia decrease comparison between the two groups, Between administration of experimental drug (H0), 24 hours after (H24), and 48 hours after (H48)|Noradrenaline use comparison between the two groups, Maximum dose, 5 days after administration of experimental drug (D5)|Renal function comparison between the two groups, Number of days alive without renal replacement therapy, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Respiratory function comparison between the two groups, Number of days alive without mechanical ventilation, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of myocardial ischemia comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of cardiogenic shock comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of mesenteric ischemia comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of digital ischemia comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of atrial fibrillation comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)|Occurrence of a thromboembolic event comparison between the two groups, 28 days after administration of experimental drug (D28)",

NCT07052045,"One-Stop manaGemEnT For A Swift Initiation of Endovascular Therapy - An International, Multicenter, Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07052045,GET-FAST,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Stroke, especially acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain, is a leading cause of death and long-term disability. When the blockage is in a large blood vessel, a procedure called endovascular therapy (EVT)-where the clot is removed using a catheter-is highly effective. However, the sooner EVT is done, the better the outcome for the patient.

Research has shown that delays between arriving at the hospital and starting EVT (called door-to-groin time) significantly reduce the chances of recovery. For example, reducing this time by just 15 minutes can mean 20 more patients (out of 1,000 treated) going home instead of to a care facility. Even a 10-minute improvement can result in over 100 extra days of independent living for patients and save more than $10,000 in healthcare costs per patient.

To reduce these delays, hospitals have improved stroke workflows. In the current standard approach, patients suspected of having a stroke are taken first to a CT scan room to confirm the diagnosis, and then, if a treatable occlusion is found, to a separate room for EVT. This usually takes around 60-70 minutes.

However, moving patients between rooms takes time. A new approach called ""One-Stop management"" could solve this. In this method, both the brain scan and the EVT procedure are done in one room-the angiography suite-using special imaging tools called flat panel CT (FDCT) and FDCT angiography (FDCT-A).

A previous study with 230 patients showed that One-Stop management is possible and saves time. But there's a challenge: the decision to follow the One-Stop pathway is made before a clear diagnosis is available. That's important because not all strokes benefit from EVT. Severe stroke symptoms (measured by a score called NIHSS ≥10) can come from:

* A large or medium vessel blockage (which EVT can treat),
* A small vessel blockage, or
* A bleed in the brain (hemorrhage). Only the first group benefits from EVT. About 85% of patients with severe symptoms fall into this category. The rest-about 15%-would not benefit, and there are concerns that FDCT might be slightly less accurate than regular CT in diagnosing these types of strokes. So, we need to test whether One-Stop management is safe and effective for all patients, not just those with treatable blockages.

To do this, the GET-FAST trial will compare the One-Stop approach to the standard two-room process. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two strategies. Importantly, this randomization won't affect their actual treatment-everyone will still receive the best care according to current medical guidelines. The main endpoint for the evaluation of the One-Stop approach will be long-term (at 90 days) disability and dependency in daily life as measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

This study will include all patients as they were assigned, regardless of what type of stroke they actually had. This is called an ""intention-to-treat"" analysis, and it provides the most reliable measure of the overall impact of One-Stop management.

Another key aspect of the trial is that any CE-certified imaging system already used in hospitals can be used for the One-Stop process-no specific brand or model is required. This makes the results more applicable to real-world hospital settings.

If GET-FAST proves that One-Stop management leads to better patient outcomes, this could transform how stroke care is delivered. More patients could return to independent living, and fewer would require long-term care-leading to major reductions in healthcare costs. For example, even a one-point improvement on a common stroke disability scale (mRS) can triple the savings in lifetime care costs.",NO,"Stroke Acute|Acute Ischemic Stroke AIS|Hemorrhagic Stroke, Intracerebral",OTHER: One Stop Management|OTHER: Usual care management,"Degree of Dependency and disability in daily activities, As assessed with the modified Rankin Scale, 90 days (+/- 15 days) after randomization","Early neurological improvement, Early neurological improvement is defined as a decrease of at least 4 points on the National Institute of Health Stoke Scale (NIHSS) compared to baseline, 5 - 7 days after randomization or discharge if earlier|Early neurological deterioration, Early neurological deterioration is defined as an increase of at least 4 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale compared to baseline, death or persistent coma, 5 - 7 days after randomization or discharge if earlier|Independent functional outcome, Defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2, 90 days (+ / - 15 days) after randomization|Cognitive function, As assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test, 90 days (+/- 15 days) after randomization|Health-related quality of life, As assessed with the Euro-Qol 5d, 90 days (+/- 15 days) after randomization|Degree of Dependency and disability in daily activities, As assessed with the modified Rankin Scale, 365 days (+/- 30 days) after randomization|Health-related quality of life, As assessed with the Euro-QoL-5D, 365 days (+/- 30 days) after randomization","Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, As defined with the Heidelberg criteria, Within 24 hours (+/- 12 hours) after randomization|Serious Adverse Events, Within 90 days after randomization|Mortality, Within 90 days after randomization"

Transfer of one particular tendon called the trapezius is becoming popular as a means of restoring function and improving pain in patients with massive rotator cuff tears. This tendon is appealing for transfer, as it has a similar line of pull to the infraspinatus (one of the rotator cuff tendons). There is currently no clear surgical consensus regarding the optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic massive irreparable rotator cuff tears that are appropriate candidates for joint salvage treatment, and no high level of evidence studies to guide clinical decision making have been published.

A pilot study is required prior to the development of a full-scale trial to assess its feasibility and recruitment across clinical sites, to determine protocol adherence (errors in randomization), and patient retention over a 12-month period.

The main objective of this pilot trial is to assess a composite measure of feasibility including recruitment, protocol adherence, and patient retention at one-year. The secondary objectives, currently exploratory only, are to determine the clinical outcomes of lower trapezius tendon transfer versus arthroscopic rotator cuff partial repair and biceps tenodesis/tenotomy on clinical outcome measures, shoulder function, adverse events and reoperation rates at two-years.

NCT07051772,Predictive Factors for the Success of Rehabilitation Programs in Chronic Low Back Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07051772,APPROCHE,RECRUITING,"Chronic low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability in the world among 19-49 year olds. The usual progression leads to 15% of acute episodes of persistent pain and more than 50% of persistent activity limitations. Persistent pain lasting between 5 and 7 years causes relatively stable patterns, probably linked to well-known predictive factors of activity limitations such as psychosocial factors (catastrophizing, fears and maladaptive beliefs), physical (deconditioning), professional (fear of returning to work, stress, burden) or personal (financial, insecurity). The effectiveness of treatments is often difficult to predict. Current evidence does not support the use of pharmacological treatments given their low effectiveness and the risks associated with the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or opioids, particularly in the chronic phase where the risk of dependence is highest. Thus, international recommendations strongly suggest the use of non-pharmacological therapies, including, physical exercises, rehabilitation, physical and sports activities and spinal manipulations. Most meta-analyses conclude that there is a cumulative effect of the different strategies, without the specific effect of each one being able to be isolated, justifying multidisciplinary protocols. A cornerstone of the management of chronic disabling low back pain therefore relies programs combining physical, cognitive-behavioral, psychological and professional care, most often in dedicated centers. The objective is to empower the patient and promote a change in behavior with regard to the consequences of their pain in the long-term. However, there are very few predictive criteria for the success or failure of these programs, probably because many multiple biological, psychological, and social factors interact over time. Certain models resulting from expert consensus seek to conceptualize these interactions and propose a categorization of these different factors. It is now crucial to validate these categorizations and their relative weight in the progression of patients to best guide their recovery. The aim of this work is to identify the biomarkers predictive of the success of multidisciplinary programs in the short-, medium- and long-term.",NO,Low Back Pain,OTHER: mobility skills testing session,"Level of disability, Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire.

NCT07051759,Back Rolls Assessment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07051759,Back rolls,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"""Back Rolls"" are basically fat deposits on the back in the form of rolls. This is a common problem in women, and concerns were encountered by cosmetic surgeons the worldwide. Deep connective tissue in the back attachments to the underlying muscle and/or periosteum divide the fat deposits on the back into multiple visual compartments. Their nomenclature is based on the anatomical area from where they have originated. The skin-fat envelope is held in place by facial attachments that are named the ""zones of adherence"".

The extent of fat deposits and number of back rolls, as well as skin laxicity, varies from person to person and also from one side to the other. The rolls surely have a zone of adherence inferiorly over which the tissue fold hangs and medially in the midline. Treatment modalities for back rolls depend on the above-mentioned variables and involve three general approaches:

1. Suction-assisted Liposuction along alone or with other modalities of skin tightening as VASER or J-Plasma ;
2. Direct surgical excision of the skin fold as an upper back lift.
3. Non- surgical: Injection lipolysis in association with weight loss. The choice of treatment depends on the specific characteristic of the back roll; hence, a classification to grade the extent of back roll would help in guiding the surgeon to choose the best possible option.",NO,Back Rolls Assesment|Back Rolls Management,PROCEDURE: Back contouring surgery,"improvement in grading of back rolls, Grade I: Back rolls that appear when the arms are kept by the side and disappear when the arms are raised.

NCT07051746,"Effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Metacognitive Training (MCT) in Patients With Schizophrenia, Depression, or Bipolar Disorder Attending a Psychiatric Day Hospital in Taiwan",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07051746,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Schizophrenia is characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, which significantly impact daily functioning. While antipsychotics are the primary treatment, many patients exhibit resistance or intolerance. Metacognitive Training (MCT) has shown promise in addressing cognitive biases related to positive symptoms, offering potential benefits as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment. Additionally, cognitive biases are prevalent in other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and major depression, and are closely related to the onset and persistence of emotional symptoms. Preliminary studies have supported the effectiveness of MCT in reducing depressive symptoms and related biases. However, its effects in Taiwan remain unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effectiveness of the Traditional Chinese version of MCT for individuals with schizophrenia in Taiwan.

This study adopts a one-group pretest-posttest design, recruiting 26 participants to undergo an 8-session MCT group intervention over four weeks. Assessments include the Chinese versions of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (C-PSYRATS), the Traditional Chinese version of the PROMIS Depression and Anxiety Short Forms (4a v1.0), the Modified Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (MCL-DACOBS), the Self-reported Graphic Personal and Social Performance Scale (SRG-PSP), Self-Reported Activities of Daily Living Scale, third version (sf-ADLS), and Neuro-QoL Item Bank v2.0 - Cognitive Function- Short Form. Participant satisfaction is also collected. Statistical analyses will utilize non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Cohen's d for effect size calculations.

Despite limitations such as a single-group design and recruitment from one hospital, this study is the first to examine MCT's applicability in Taiwanese clinical settings.

NCT07051577,The Effect of Neuroscience-Based Exercise Training on Shooting Performance and Neuromuscular Performance in Archers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07051577,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Archery is a sport that demands sport-specific motor performance, emphasizing fine motor control, postural stability, balance, and concentration skills. Athletes aim to deliver the arrow to the target by ensuring maximum stability with minimal body movement during shooting. While muscle strength, upper extremity endurance, and overall body stability are among the primary factors influencing performance, many other parameters also determine shooting success. Studies investigating muscle activity in archery have demonstrated that the primary muscle groups involved in shooting are the scapular muscles, shoulder girdle muscles, and forearm muscles. These muscles are activated at varying levels to facilitate target focus and play an active role in shooting by contributing to postural and scapular stabilization. Additionally, core muscles enhance movement capacity by centrally stabilizing the body during motion. Activation of pelvic-region muscles, in particular, contributes to improved balance skills, thereby making a meaningful impact on performance.

Archers are expected to maintain stability by minimizing movement during shooting and to rapidly adapt to postural instability that may arise during aiming. Every involuntary movement decreases stability and makes it harder to hit the center of the target. In this context, executing motor actions with high precision and developing adaptive responses to postural instability are of great importance. One of the core components of the balance system-the visual system-also significantly affects performance. During postural sway, visual stabilization plays a critical role; as the distance to the target increases, displacements on the retina become larger, making visual focusing more challenging. Moreover, to make the shooting decision at the right moment, it is essential to maintain visual concentration effectively.

In this project, while no intervention will be applied to the control group, archers using classical bows in the exercise group will participate in a six-week neuroscience-based exercise program. The program includes scapular and core stabilization, balance training, gaze stabilization, and NeuroTracker training. This six-week program is designed to be progressive and holistic, and its effects will be investigated.

Muscle activity will be analyzed through EMG, postural sway will be assessed using the ProKin TecnoBody 252 stabilometric platform, clinical upper extremity balance will be evaluated with the Y Balance Test, eye tracking will be measured using the Pupil headset (Pupil Labs), and spinal stabilization endurance will be assessed through the Biering-Sorensen Test, Lateral Bridge Test, and the Step Test. Shooting performance will be evaluated based on target paper scores. Statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS version 28. Both descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be utilized. Within the scope of descriptive statistics, participants' demographic characteristics and other key variables will be summarized using mean (X̄), standard deviation (SD), frequency (n), and percentage (%). The findings will be evaluated at a significance level of p\<0.05.

The study will include a comprehensive analysis using objective measurement methods. In the literature, no previous study has approached neuroscience-based exercise interventions for archers in such a comprehensive and multidimensional manner. This project aims not only to enhance athletic performance but also to prevent shoulder, scapular, and upper extremity injuries that may result from repetitive shooting movements. This research will be one of the first comprehensive studies to address balance, muscle activity, and cognitive performance in archery holistically, offering an original and scientifically valuable contribution to the sports science literature.",NO,Archery|Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation|Muscle Activity|Visual Rehabilitation|Core Stabilization Exercise Therapy,OTHER: Exercise Group|OTHER: control group,"Shooting Performance, Each participant will perform two sets of archery shots on a 40 cm target face at an 18-meter shooting range, with 3 arrows per set.

Often, there is no bacterial cause for fever found, and in the setting of a well patient with resolved fever, some studies have shown it to be safe to cease antibiotic therapy which was commenced at the onset of fever. This reduces the overall exposure to antibiotics, which can be beneficial to the patient (reduced risk of resistant bugs emerging, reduced serious side effects). However, some subgroups of high-risk patients have been underrepresented in these studies (in particular, those who have received a bone marrow transplant from a donor, those with longer duration of low white cells) and none have been performed in Australia, hence applying this data to our setting and patient groups is indirect and further data are needed. This study plans to recruit participants who have received chemotherapy for acute leukemia or a stem cell transplant (either their own cells or a donor's cells) or CAR T-cell therapy and perform a trial to compare early stopping of antibiotics (STOP arm) to the standard of care, which traditionally involves continuing antibiotics until the white cell count reaches above a specific threshold.

NCT07051473,Relationship Between Coronary CT Angiography Findings and Prognosis Of Patients Undergoing PCI,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07051473,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Researchers at Cerrahpaşa Medical School in Istanbul are studying how a heart imaging test called coronary CT angiography can help improve care for people with coronary artery disease. This disease happens when fatty buildups, known as plaques, form in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Over time, these plaques can limit blood flow and lead to serious problems like heart attacks. The goal of this research is to better understand which types of plaques may lead to worse outcomes, and how treatment choices-such as placing a stent or using medication-can affect a person's long-term heart health. This study will help doctors make better treatment decisions in the future. Some plaques are more dangerous than others, even when they don't cause major blockages. These are called high-risk or ""vulnerable"" plaques. Even though they may not narrow the artery much at first, they can still cause heart attacks in the future. Currently, doctors do not usually place stents in arteries unless the plaque causes a serious blockage. This is because stenting also carries risks, and it is not clear whether treating high-risk plaques early-before they cause problems-helps people live longer or feel better. This study hopes to find out whether certain types of plaques should be treated differently in the future. This study will include at least 789 adults who have already had coronary CT angiography as part of their regular care at Cerrahpaşa Medical School's cardiology clinic. These participants were treated either with a stent or with medication, depending on their medical needs. The decision to do the scan and how to treat the person was made by their doctor, following national and international medical guidelines. People who join the study do so voluntarily. They can choose to leave the study at any time without affecting their regular medical care. Participants will be followed for at least one year, starting from the day of their CT scan. They will return for check-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months. After the first year, they will continue to have yearly follow-up visits as part of routine care. At each visit, the study team will check symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath; monitor health indicators, like cholesterol and blood sugar; and review any new heart procedures or treatments. Researchers will also review results from medical tests, such as blood tests, electrocardiograms (EKGs), heart ultrasounds (echocardiograms), repeat heart scans or procedures if done. If a participant has had a heart procedure done at another hospital, they will be asked to bring those records to their next appointment. This helps the research team get a full picture of each participant's heart health. The researchers will look at the features of the plaques seen in each participant's heart scan. They want to find out which types of plaques are more likely to lead to heart attacks or other serious problems. Participants will be divided into groups based on whether they received a stent or not. The researchers will compare outcomes between these groups to see if certain plaque types are more dangerous and whether stenting made a difference. The study will try to answer questions like: which plaque features are linked to future heart problems; do people with high-risk plaques do better with stents or with medication; can doctors use plaque features to decide who should get a stent? This research may help doctors better identify high-risk plaques and choose the right treatment for each person. The study does not involve any new, experimental, or unapproved treatments. All participants will receive medical care that follows well-established guidelines from groups like the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA). Participants are not asked to take new medications or undergo any tests or treatments that are not already part of their usual care. If new medical knowledge becomes available during the study that could affect treatment, participants will be informed and can choose whether to continue with the original plan or make changes. All personal and medical information will be kept confidential. The data will be stored securely in the hospital's system, and only the research team and authorised health officials will be allowed to access it. Participants' names and other identifying information will not appear in any published reports. If a participant wants to know their results or the overall results of the study, they can ask for a report.

This innovative approach aims to significantly enhance the early identification of lung cancer, potentially catching it at its most treatable stages through a simple cheek swab.

How it works The effectiveness of AIR-DS stems from its ability to identify small biochemical changes in cells from the inner cheek. These biochemical changes can serve as early indicators of lung cancer. The procedure involves taking a cheek swab, which is then analysed using non-damaging infrared light technology.

The RADICAL REACT study To introduce this technology into a healthcare setting the sponsor needs to validate its effectiveness through rigorous testing.

The RADICAL REACT trial plans to involve around 450 participants highly suspected to have lung cancer. Each participant will provide a cheek swab and basic medical history information during a single clinic visit. The data collected will be analysed with AIR-DS to identify whether individuals with lung cancer can be identified accurately.

Why it matters AIR-DS could significantly advance lung cancer detection, focusing on early, accurate diagnosis through a non-invasive cheek swab. Beyond improving patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention, it also introduces a cost-effective approach to early lung cancer detection.

Many CWP patients experience inadequate treatment and poor symptom management, leaving them prone to disability. Pain Reprocessing Therapy (PRT) is a novel therapy specifically designed to target nociplastic pain with a combination of cognitive, exposure-based, and interoceptively-focused psychotherapy techniques.

Investigators propose to determine the efficacy of combining two known anti-depressant treatments shown to be effective in non-stroke depression, aerobic exercise (AEx) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on post-stroke depressive symptoms. This project is based on the idea that depression negatively affects the potential for the brain to adapt in response to treatment such that rehabilitation may not produce the same changes that it does in non-depressed individuals. Investigators believe that effective treatment for PSD will result in a virtuous cycle whereby reducing depression enhances response to rehabilitation, thereby facilitating functional gains.

NCT07050329,"Comparison of Operation Time, Drain Duration, and Seroma Formation After Modified Radical Mastectomy Using Ultrasonic Dissector Versus Electrocautery in Women With Breast Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07050329,,COMPLETED,"The goal of this clinical trial was to compare two surgical techniques-ultrasonic dissector and electrocautery-for performing axillary dissection in women undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast cancer. The study aimed to determine whether using an ultrasonic dissector reduces operation time, the number of days surgical drains remain in place, and the frequency of seroma formation compared to conventional electrocautery.

The main questions the study aims to answer are:

1. Does the ultrasonic dissector reduce the duration of surgery compared to electrocautery?
2. Do patients operated with an ultrasonic dissector require surgical drains for fewer days?
3. Is the frequency of postoperative seroma formation lower in the ultrasonic dissector group?

Researchers randomly (1:1) assigned 138 women with breast cancer (aged 35-65 years) undergoing MRM to either the ultrasonic dissector group or the electrocautery group. All surgeries were performed by experienced consultant surgeons using standardized protocols.

Participants:

* Underwent MRM with either electrocautery or ultrasonic dissector for axillary dissection
* Were discharged 24 hours after surgery with two drains in place
* Measured and reported daily drain output at home
* Returned for weekly follow-up for 30 days postoperatively

Outcomes were measured by recording the operation time, the number of days drains remained in place, and the occurrence of seroma.

This research will be the first to study a military adaptation of Life Force, which aims to enhance mental toughness.

The program involves weekly 75-minute training sessions, led by skilled Life Force trainers from the study team, focused on the ""Five Cs"" of mental toughness: Control, Commitment, Challenge, Confidence, and Connection.

Participants complete a 15-20 minute baseline survey. However, study eligibility isn't guaranteed and is determined by an AI machine learning algorithm built from existing military administrative and health records (EHR from the past 5 years, DEERS, DMDC, and DMSS data) to predict who will benefit most from this training. Consent is required to combine this existing data with survey responses to evaluate the program's effectiveness.

Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the Life Force training or a control group. The training group is scheduled for six 75-minute weekly group sessions, starting within the next two weeks.

High diagnostic rates of cancer and various treatments can significantly impact patients' sleep quality, leading to diverse sleep disorders. Cancer-related insomnia (CRI) is a prevalent sleep disturbance among cancer patients, potentially associated with the tumor itself, treatment modalities (such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), psychological status, pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. Although reported incidence rates vary across studies, CRI is consistently high and severely compromises patients' quality of life. Core symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, sleep maintenance difficulties, and early morning awakening, which contribute to daytime fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, ultimately detrimentally affecting patients' health and quality of life. The pathogenesis of CRI is complex, potentially involving multiple factors including the tumor's direct effects, treatment side effects, psychological distress, pain, and fatigue.

These leaks can lead to heart failure and/or life-threatening hemolysis.

Percutaneous closure of para-prosthetic leaks has developed as an alternative to surgery in high-risk surgical patients. These procedures remain difficult on the technical side with a significant risk of failure and complications but have been improving since the development of dedicated prostheses and the increase in operator experience.

A sharing of experience through the creation of an international expert group has been initiated since 2017 formalised by biannual expert meetings, the elaboration of recommendations in progress and the establishment of an international observatory PVLC1(CCTIRS N°16-62) on 2017-2019.

Beyond the technical aspects and the follow-up of major cardiovascular events collected in PVLC1, the investigators also wonder what impact these procedures have on the quality of life of patients. The investigators suggest that even a partial decrease in para-prosthetic leakage may be associated with an improvement in quality of life by reducing the need for transfusion and/or reducing dyspnea.

NCT07049952,BabySTrong II taVNS Feeding Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049952,BabySTrong II,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The long-term goal of this project proposal is to develop and commercialize a therapy to assist pre-term and term infants with brain injury overcome difficulties in learning to feed. Independent feeding is critical for infants to be discharged home with their families and avoid the burdens of placement of a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) for direct stomach feeding of prolonged home nasogastric feeding. The current standard of care for infants with feeding difficulty involves early oromotor stimulation and feeding practice with therapists who guide safe feeding. Few other therapies exist for infants who are not making progress with feeding volumes at term age. Technologies currently on the market are used to stimulate early sucking patterns at 31-32 weeks gestational age, but have not been shown to stimulate active feeding in older infants. Other technologies monitor parameters, such as suck amplitude, but no technologies actively improve oral feeding in older infants whose main reason for continued hospitalization is feeding delays.

To tackle this problem, we took the novel approach of pairing a non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) stimulation with bottle feeding. In these first-in-infant open-label pilot studies 54% of infants in discussions for G-tube placement for feeding delay, reached full feeds within 2 weeks, and even infants who did not achieve full feeds improved their po feeding volumes. Further, infants who got to full feeds showed stronger and more complex circuits associated with motor skills, suggesting neuroplasticity associated with the activity of taVNS-paired with feeding.

During the phase I STTR award period, we customized and refined the taVNS unit operation, worked with manufacturers to make it specifically fit the needs of our infants and involved our parent and therapist advisors in deciding on a product. With this easy to use, compact set-up, we will test the BabySTrong feeding system in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded trial to show efficacy in improving the daily feeding volumes, the days to full oral feeds, and/or the number of infants who avoid G-tube placement and increased neuroplasticity in white matter circuits. If this groundbreaking new approach to infant feeding is successful, we may impact length of stay and associated hospital and outpatient costs, and address family and care provider burdens and frustrations inherent with feeding delays. The findings from this proposal will support our FDA application and commercialization plans for the BabySTrong system.

Interventions by the community pharmacist in the fight against this misuse seem interesting, but an intervention upstream of potential problems of proper use seems even more relevant to us.

NCT07049770,Eczeva Supplementation and Skin Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049770,,COMPLETED,"Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflamed, itchy, and often dry skin. It commonly affects individuals of all ages, although it frequently begins during childhood. The causes of eczema are multifactorial, including genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Genetic mutations, such as those in the FLG gene responsible for producing filaggrin, a protein vital to skin barrier function, play a significant role (1). Immune system dysregulation, particularly an overactive response to environmental allergens, also contributes to eczema (2). Environmental triggers are diverse and include irritants like soaps, detergents, and disinfectants, as well as allergens such as pollen, pet dander, dust mites, mold, and certain foods (3-8). Climatic conditions, such as cold or dry air, and high humidity, can exacerbate symptoms, as can exposure to air pollution and chlorinated water in swimming pools (3-8). Specific skincare products containing allergens or irritants may worsen the condition. Other factors influencing eczema include infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal) (9), dietary triggers like dairy, nuts, eggs, and soy (10), and clothing choices, with materials like wool and synthetics or tight-fitting clothes aggravating symptoms through skin irritation and friction (11, 12).

Individuals with certain habits or characteristics are at a higher risk of developing eczema. A family history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever significantly increases the likelihood of the condition, as it suggests a genetic predisposition (13). Emotional stress and anxiety are known to trigger or worsen eczema symptoms (14), as are hormonal changes during pregnancy or menstruation, which can cause flare-ups (15). People who sweat excessively may experience irritation and aggravation of eczema, as the moisture can exacerbate inflammation (16). Smoking or exposure to cigarette smoke is another contributing factor, known to both trigger and worsen eczema (17). Those working in professions with frequent exposure to irritants or allergens, such as healthcare or cleaning, are at higher risk due to contact with harsh chemicals (18). Additionally, excessive hand washing can strip the skin of its natural moisture, leading to irritation and exacerbating eczema symptoms (18).

The main active ingredient in Eczeva is Melicope ptelefolia. Melicope ptelefolia, commonly known as Tenggek Burung, has been used for centuries in traditional herbal medicine to treat various skin conditions, including wounds, itches, and skin diseases (19). The plant is known for its high content of bioactive compounds, particularly 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-geranyl acetophenone (tHGA) and 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-prenyl acetophenone (tHPA). Among these, tHGA has shown significant potential due to its inhibitory effects on lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, suggesting its anti-inflammatory properties that may help in treating conditions like eczema (20). An in vitro study demonstrated that tHGA reduced inflammatory markers and enhanced the integrity of the skin barrier, both of which are crucial for managing inflammation-related conditions like eczema (21). Further research also indicated that tHGA could improve epithelial barrier function and reduce cell permeability in inflamed tissues, a key factor in treating eczema, which is characterized by an impaired skin barrier function (22). These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Melicope ptelefolia in managing eczema through its anti-inflammatory and barrier-strengthening effects.

NCT07049549,The Effectiveness of Root Planing and Injectable Platelet-Rich Fibrin in Smoking Patients With Periodontitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049549,,COMPLETED,"Periodontitis is a chronic, multifactorial inflammatory disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the tissues supporting the teeth, associated with dysbiotic plaque biofilms. The foundation of non-surgical periodontal treatment is the mechanical debridement of the tooth surfaces to reduce bacterial load. In this phase, dental calculus and bacterial deposits are removed, and root surfaces are smoothened. This helps eliminate the microorganisms responsible for inflammation. Following treatment, epithelial healing occurs in the form of long epithelial attachment, which re-forms within approximately one week. The reduction of inflammatory cells, tissue repair, and decreased gingival crevicular fluid flow lead to the resolution of clinical signs such as redness and swelling. A tissue recession of 1-2 mm is generally observed. The fibrils in the connective tissue are altered or lysed during the disease process, and their reorganization and healing may take several weeks.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effects (plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level) of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF) in addition to non-surgical periodontal treatment in periodontitis patients with deep pockets and smoking habits.

In advanced cases, surgical treatments may be required. According to the study by Heitz-Mayfield and colleagues, surgical treatment in pockets deeper than 6 mm resulted in a 0.6 mm greater reduction in probing depth and 0.2 mm more clinical attachment gain compared to scaling and root planing alone. However, for pockets between 4-6 mm in depth, non-surgical treatment resulted in 0.4 mm more attachment gain compared to surgical procedures. In a systematic review by Labriola and colleagues, it was found that smokers had a lesser reduction in pocket depth. Furthermore, Scabbia and colleagues reported that smokers had significantly lower clinical improvements after surgical treatment. Smoking negatively affects healing, and factors such as exposed root surfaces and protected areas for residual plaque contribute to disease recurrence. Long-term studies have shown that smokers experience higher tooth loss.

The use of blood-derived products in wound healing started 40 years ago, with fibrin adhesives standing out. Fibrin is the activated form of fibrinogen, a plasma molecule, and is the final product of coagulation. Polymerized fibrin forms the initial scar matrix in the wound area, serving as a biological adhesive that aids in hemostasis.

One of the most commonly used blood-derived products in dentistry is platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). Developed by Choukroun in 2001, this second-generation product can be prepared without anticoagulants, thrombin, or gelling agents. It is a simple and cost-effective method. Injectable PRF (I-PRF) is obtained by altering the centrifugation speed and duration. Miron and colleagues demonstrated that low-speed I-PRF contains a higher number of regenerative cells and growth factors. A study by Kour and colleagues showed that I-PRF has antimicrobial effects against periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.

In conclusion, I-PRF, prepared from the patient's own blood, may provide biological support to non-surgical periodontal treatment, positively influencing the healing process and reducing the need for surgical interventions. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical effects (plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, clinical attachment level) of I-PRF in conjunction with non-surgical periodontal treatment in periodontitis patients with deep pockets and smoking habits.

A total of 25 volunteers will be included in the study. Inclusion criteria are: not pregnant, no use of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, or systemic corticosteroids, no periodontal treatment in the past 6 months, presence of at least 20 teeth, bleeding on probing in ≥30% of sites, and at least two non-adjacent teeth in each quadrant with probing depth ≥5 mm, clinical attachment loss ≥4 mm, and radiographic evidence of bone loss in the coronal third (horizontal and/or vertical). Informed consent will be obtained after explaining the study.

Eligible participants will undergo clinical periodontal evaluation including plaque index (Silness \& Löe, 1964), gingival index (Löe \& Silness, 1963), probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing (Ainamo \& Bay, 1975). At the second visit, full-mouth scaling and root planing will be performed. In the test sites, injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF), prepared by centrifugation at 700 rpm for 3 minutes, will be applied.

NCT07049536,Physical Fitness of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049536,,RECRUITING,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a treatment used to restore blood cell function in diseases of myeloid and lymphoid origin, which can be malignant or non-malignant. There are two types: autologous transplantation, which uses the patient's own stem cells, and allogeneic transplantation, which uses stem cells from a donor after a high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy preparation. This process can lead to complications such as immune reactions, infections, and organ toxicity, affecting the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. These complications often reduce physical activity, muscle strength, lung function, and quality of life.

Before transplantation, it is important to assess patients' comorbidities, functional status, and physical fitness to evaluate their ability to tolerate treatment and risk of complications. Low exercise tolerance and impaired physical function are linked to poorer outcomes. Objective tests of physical function provide valuable information about health status. Pre-transplant muscle strength and cardiopulmonary fitness influence post-transplant recovery, so comprehensive assessments are necessary.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation support patients by preparing them for treatment, maintaining health during therapy, improving physical function after treatment, and enhancing quality of life in palliative care. Exercise improves functional capacity, quality of life, and daily activities, but symptoms like fatigue, pain, breathlessness, and muscle weakness, as well as other barriers, may limit participation.

Physical fitness is the body's ability to perform daily activities efficiently. Reduced fitness leads to frailty and decreased function, which are associated with increased treatment toxicity and mortality. Although the importance of physical fitness before transplantation is recognized, data from objective measurements are limited. Common pre-transplant assessments include lung function tests, walking tests, handgrip strength, and mobility tests.

NCT07049484,Clinical and Biomechanical Outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Associated With Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis (LET),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049484,LETOTT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the main stabilizers of the knee joint, and its injury is among the most common soft tissue injuries of the knee. Several surgical reconstruction techniques are available, utilizing various tissues as a graft for the neo-ligament, including both autografts and allografts.

The ""Over-the-top single-bundle technique with gracilis and semitendinosus tendons combined with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET)"" was developed in 1998 by Prof. Marcacci and Prof. Zaffagnini, and it is still the preferred method for ACL reconstruction at the Second Clinic of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute.

Cadaveric biomechanical studies have shown that combining LET with ACL reconstruction improves knee joint stability in both the anteroposterior and rotational planes. However, a recent in vivo study has challenged this hypothesis, showing that in patients undergoing surgery, the addition of LET enhances knee stability only in the anteroposterior direction and only for a limited period of six months. At twelve months postoperatively, joint laxity appeared similar to that of patients who did not undergo the additional procedure. Furthermore, the same study did not assess rotational instability using the pivot-shift test, an essential parameter as it is closely linked to knee stability and the patient's subjective perception of surgical success.

Despite the increasing use of LET in conjunction with ACL reconstruction, few studies have analyzed the short-term postoperative effects of lateral extra-articular tenodesis and its potential benefits during the early stages of rehabilitation and return to sport.

This study was conceived in response to this clinical question, with the goal of evaluating anteroposterior and rotational laxity in a group of patients who underwent ACL reconstruction combined with LET, in order to analyze clinical outcomes and, most importantly, any changes in stability during the early postoperative period.

These proteins in turn are composed out of smaller building blocks, called amino acids. By consuming a sufficient amount of dietary protein, a sufficient amount of amino acids become available to build new muscle proteins. The body's ability to build these new muscle proteins is of great importance to maintain muscle strength and function.

Previous research suggests that a meal containing proteins from meat results in a better stimulation of the body's ability to build muscle proteins, when compared to a meal containing only plant-based proteins. However, these previous studies have only been performed following the ingestion of a single meal. As a result it is currently unknown how the muscles respond to a more prolonged ingestion of a diet containing animal/meat products, in comparison to a plant-based diet.

NCT07049094,The Analgesic Effect of Scalp Nerve Block Using Bupivacaine Liposomes for Postoperative Pain Relief After Craniotomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07049094,,RECRUITING,"After undergoing craniotomy, 60% to 84% of neurosurgery patients experience moderate to severe acute pain, primarily in the first 48 hours. This pain is mostly superficial, affecting the muscles and soft tissues around the skull. Poor pain management can lead to complications such as restlessness, nausea, hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, and prolonged recovery, potentially resulting in chronic headaches.

Opioids are commonly used to manage this pain but can cause significant side effects like sedation, nausea, and increased intracranial pressure, which can mask serious conditions. Non-opioid medications and scalp infiltration techniques can help but may not provide sufficient pain relief for the duration needed.

Currently, multimodal analgesia, particularly scalp nerve blocks, is advocated in neurosurgical recovery practices. These blocks are effective and simpler to perform, but the effects of long-acting local anesthetics, like bupivacaine, typically last only 24 hours. Since pain often persists longer than that, there is a need for better pain management strategies.

Liposome bupivacaine is a new long-acting local anesthetic approved by the FDA, offering pain relief for up to 72 hours compared to regular bupivacaine's 8-hour duration. Its effectiveness has been confirmed in various nerve block procedures, but it has not been reported for scalp nerve blocks.

NCT07048977,Early NK Precut vs TPS in Difficult Cannulation: A RCT (ENKPT Trial),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07048977,ENKPT,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Hello. This study is about a special kind of endoscopy called ERCP, which is used to treat bile duct infections, gallstones, and blockages that cause jaundice. Normally, doctors use a standard method to insert a tube into the bile duct during the procedure. However, even skilled doctors sometimes have trouble - in about 10% to 20% of patients, it's difficult to get the tube in.

When this happens, doctors use advanced techniques called ""precut"" methods to help make the procedure successful. One of these is called ""early needle-knife precut,"" which is done after trying for 5 minutes without success. Studies have shown this method can reduce the chance of getting pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) afterward.

There are two common types of these advanced techniques:

Needle-knife precut over a pancreatic stent, which gently opens the area using a small cut over a temporary plastic tube.

Transpancreatic sphincterotomy, which also helps open the duct through a different approach.

Both methods can help the procedure succeed and have similar safety results. However, not many studies have compared these two methods early on in the procedure when a pancreatic stent is used.

This study wants to compare them in a safe and scientific way. If you or your family member agrees to join, the doctor will explain everything clearly.

Previous studies have reported good reliability and validity for this scale. According to the evaluation criteria provided by the Chinese Psychiatric Rating Scale Cooperative Group:

1. A total score above 29 indicates severe anxiety;
2. Above 21 indicates definite marked anxiety;
3. Above 14 indicates definite anxiety;
4. Above 7 suggests possible anxiety;
5. Below 7 signifies no anxiety symptoms. Previous studies have commonly used 14 as the cut-off score, with higher total scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status（RBANS）, This scale is used to assess participants' cognitive function. It offers advantages in clinical applications including concise administration, user-friendly operation, and sensitive/responsive results. Patients experiencing depressive episodes demonstrate high compliance with completion. The RBANS includes five domain scores:

* Immediate Memory: Reflects the participant's ability to retain information immediately after presentation;

  * Visuospatial/Constructional: Reflects the participant's ability to perceive spatial relationships and accurately reproduce drawings;

    * Language: Reflects the participant's verbal fluency and naming abilities; ④ Attention: Reflects the participant's working memory capacity and ability to access short-term memory stores through visual and verbal modalities; ⑤ Delayed Memory: Reflects the participant's anterograde memory capacity., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale（TESS）, Among comparable scales, it provides the most comprehensive item coverage-assessing both common adverse symptoms/signs and multiple laboratory findings. The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) requires clinicians to evaluate each symptom across three dimensions: Severity, Relationship to Intervention, and Action Taken.

Severity is rated on a 0-4 scale:

0 = Absence of the symptom;

1. = Occasional presence of the symptom;
2. = Mild severity, no impairment to routine functioning;
3. = Moderate severity, producing some impairment to routine functioning;
4. = Severe, causing significant impairment or disability to routine functioning., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Event-related potential（ERP）, ERP data acquisition in the laboratory was performed using the Curry system with an internationally standard 64-channel electrode cap. The right mastoid (M2) served as the reference electrode. Electrodes were attached above and below the left orbit to record vertical electro-oculogram (VEOG), and electrodes were placed at the outer canthi of both eyes to record horizontal electro-oculogram (HEOG). ERP data acquisition commenced once all electrode impedances were reduced below 5 kΩ.

For ERP data analysis, the recorded signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz and continuously sampled at 500 Hz. The data were segmented into epochs of 1700 ms duration, including a 200-ms pre-stimulus baseline period and a 1500-ms post-stimulus period. The peak amplitudes of ERP components were calculated separately for each experimental group., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 4 weeks|Eye Movement（EM）, Participant Preparation: Adjust the chair height and chin rest so that the participant's horizontal line of sight aligns with the center of the screen or the center of the upper half of the screen. Adjust the orientation of the eye tracker using its mount to ensure the eye being tracked is centered in the image on the operator's monitor.

Calibration: Perform calibration using the eye tracker to ensure the participant's eye is within its field of view. Ensure accurate identification of the eye and corneal reflection points through automatic threshold adjustment or manual adjustment.

In the ImRs group memory reactivation to criticism-related memories is followed by positive reappraisal. ImRs-DSR introduces a 10-minute delay before reappraisal to enhance memory updating. CFT_ImRs incorporates Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) principles into reappraisal, emphasizing self-compassion.

Primary outcomes include skin conductance level (SCL) and subjective emotional responses to criticism-related (and control) memories, changes in fear of failure and dysfunctional beliefs. All these variables are assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Results will be analyzed separately for:

Cleft lip and palate are rare diseases, accounting for around 30% of all facial clefts, which occur at a rate of 1/750 births in Europe. Deformation of the nose and nasal septum is constant, and more or less severe in unilateral forms.

In the absence of rhino-septoplasty performed during primary cleft repair surgery, deformities persist in children and adolescents. There is a significant aesthetic impact in children, which generally increases in adolescents. The problem of nasal obstruction causes functional discomfort that can be disabling. Open rhino-septoplasty is a standard procedure and is proposed as a secondary treatment in this population . It is indicated during growth in cases of nasal obstruction, or as a function of aesthetic demands.

The hypothesis is that secondary rhino-septoplasty gives long-term satisfaction in patients in terms of aesthetics and respiratory function. The originality of this study lies in the use of the recently validated CLEFT-Q questionnaire to assess the aesthetic and functional satisfaction of patients in adulthood after secondary rhino-septoplasty performed in childhood or adolescence.

The research focuses on evaluating an innovative rehabilitation approach that addresses common problems observed in children with CP, such as trunk instability, reduced respiratory capacity, and postural abnormalities.

In individuals with CP, the ineffective use of respiratory muscles affects not only the respiratory system but also trunk control and overall motor performance. While most existing studies emphasize inspiratory muscle training, research on expiratory muscle training remains limited. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap by investigating the neuromotor effects of expiratory muscle training, a subfield of respiratory rehabilitation, in children with CP.

The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be assigned to either an expiratory muscle training group or a sham group. Pre- and post-intervention assessments will include measurements of respiratory muscle strength, balance evaluation, postural analysis, and standardized assessments of selective motor control and trunk control.

The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of a more holistic rehabilitation approach for children with CP.

Weakening of the diaphragm leads to a decrease in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), which may result in respiratory insufficiency, postural instability, and urinary incontinence (UI). Additionally, post-stroke reduction in diaphragmatic mobility and decreased activity of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles on the paretic side may disrupt the piston mechanism between the diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles. These mechanical changes may trigger the development of urinary incontinence. This study aims to investigate the relationship between diaphragm muscle strength and endurance and urinary incontinence in 50 stroke patients.

Although surgical and medical treatments are available, many individuals seek non-invasive alternatives.

Pelvic floor muscle training, also known as Kegel exercises, aims to strengthen the pelvic muscles that support the bladder and other pelvic organs. The use of vaginal Kegel balls may enhance the effects of these exercises by promoting increased muscle activation and pelvic awareness.

Preliminary findings suggest that regular pelvic floor muscle training may improve urinary control and enhance sexual function through improved muscle strength and proprioception.

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle exercises and Kegel ball utilization as non-invasive options for improving pelvic health, urinary continence, and sexual well-being.

A total of 40 female participants with pelvic floor muscle weakness, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction will be enrolled. All participants will undergo a physical examination. Muscle strength will be assessed using the Modified Oxford Scale, and prolapse levels, if present, will be determined using the Simplified POP-Q classification. Sociodemographic data will be collected, and participants will complete three face-to-face questionnaires.

The Sandvick Severity Index (SSI) will be used to assess the severity of urinary incontinence. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), a validated questionnaire, will assess incontinence-related quality of life. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), another validated instrument, will be used to assess sexual dysfunction.

Participants will be randomized by drawing from closed envelopes containing 20 cards labeled ""0"" and 20 labeled ""1."" Those who draw a ""0"" will be assigned to the control group and will perform pelvic floor Kegel exercises. Those who draw a ""1"" will be assigned to the study group, which will perform the same exercises as the control group, along with the use of a vaginal Kegel exercise ball.

All participants will receive a 6-week home-based exercise program targeting both fast-twitch (Type II) and slow-twitch (Type I) pelvic muscle fibers. The program will include fast and slow contractions, with imagery and analogies to improve comprehension. For fast contractions, the ""open-close the tap"" analogy will be used. For slow contractions, participants will be instructed to ""squeeze while counting to five, hold for five, and relax for five,"" with the visualization of an elevator slowly ascending, stopping, and descending.

Each exercise set will consist of ten rapid and ten slow contractions. Participants will be instructed to perform five sets per day during the first three weeks and increase to ten sets per day in the last three weeks. This equates to a total of 50 rapid and 50 slow contractions daily in the initial phase, increasing to 100 of each by the end of the intervention.

Exercise tracking forms will be provided to allow participants to monitor compliance and document each completed session.

Participants in the study group will be given a pelvic Kegel exercise ball to use. This device is 13.5 cm in total length, with a 3.5 cm ball width, weighs approximately 90 grams, and is made of medical-grade silicone. It contains two inner jiggle balls designed to generate passive vibrations against the vaginal wall during movement, potentially stimulating pelvic muscle activity.

After receiving instruction on safe usage, participants in the study group will wear the Kegel ball for 30 minutes daily during the first three weeks, and for one hour daily during the final three weeks, while engaging in light daily activities such as walking or household movements.

In robotic surgeries, the instruments have superior maneuverability compared to the human wrist, allowing for more precise work in delicate areas with a three-dimensional view while eliminating the surgeon's hand tremor. On the other hand, despite advances in surgical techniques, anesthesia management, and intensive care, a significant proportion of geriatric patients experience cognitive decline after surgery. Postoperative cognitive function decline can reduce the quality of life and lead to significant damage to family and social support systems. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), defined as a decline in cognitive function following surgeries performed under general anesthesia, is a common postoperative cognitive impairment, particularly in the elderly population. Studies have shown that the incidence of POCD in individuals aged 60 and above ranges between 20% and 40%. Additionally, POCD is associated with prolonged hospital stays, reduced mobility, and increased mortality. Patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic radical surgery assume the Trendelenburg position, which provides better exposure of the pelvic organs. However, in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries, patients must be placed in a steep Trendelenburg position. Prolonged pneumoperitoneum and excessive head-down tilt can increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. As a result of the Trendelenburg position, intracranial pressure may increase, leading to brain hypoxia, inadequate cerebral blood flow, low arterial oxygen content, anemia, and high brain oxygen consumption. Impaired cerebral oxygenation can directly affect brain function. Compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery, patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery tend to exhibit prolonged emergence from anesthesia and increased psychomotor agitation due to factors such as stress response, trauma, anesthesia, bleeding, and transfusion. This condition is influenced by factors such as decreased cerebral blood flow and hypotension. Therefore, real-time monitoring methods are needed to detect and address cerebral hypoxia. While diagnostic tools like computed tomography (CT), echocardiography (ECHO), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal brain damage at a later stage, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a continuous, safe, and non-invasive method for detecting cerebral hypoxia. Identifying oxygen deficiency in the brain can allow adjustments in treatment strategies and help prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction, potentially reducing patients' intensive care and hospital stay durations while minimizing complications. Recently, certain medications have been used to prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Dexmedetomidine, a drug with neuroprotective properties, is commonly used perioperatively in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Pharmacologically, dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenergic agonist with sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic, and diuretic effects. However, previous clinical studies evaluating the effects of dexmedetomidine on POCD in elderly patients have yielded inconsistent results. This study aims to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on recovery from anesthesia and postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing robotic urologic surgery, particularly focusing on its neuroprotective properties. Patients included in our study will be randomly divided into two groups. Both groups will undergo routine standard ASA monitoring, NIRS, and BIS monitoring. Both groups will receive standard anesthesia induction. Then, one group will receive sevoflurane + remifentanil, while the other group will receive dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusion along with sevoflurane. Both patient groups will undergo the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before and after the operation. During the intraoperative period, anesthesia depth will be monitored using BIS (maintaining the depth between 40 and 60 for both groups), and oxygenation will be tracked using NIRS. Our study will include geriatric patients undergoing robotic urologic surgery. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. The randomization process will be performed using a web-based randomization program (Sortition), which is defined for validity.

NCT07047820,A Study to Learn More About How Zuranolone Affects Postpartum Depression Symptoms in Participants Who Took it Within 1 Year After The End of Their Pregnancy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047820,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In this study, researchers will learn more about how zuranolone affects the symptoms of postpartum depression, also known as PPD. Zuranolone is a drug that healthcare professionals can prescribe for adults with PPD. After giving birth, adults with PPD can suffer from symptoms such as tiredness, sadness, and a loss of interest in their daily activities.

This study is known as an ""observational"" study, which means it collects health information about study participants after a healthcare professional has already prescribed treatment. Participants for this study will be found in the United States using a database from CVS Specialty Pharmacy. This will include anyone who was prescribed zuranolone between June 2025 and May 2026 and who filled the prescription within 1 year after the end of their pregnancy.

The main goal of this study is to learn more about how zuranolone affects the participants' PPD symptoms. This will be measured using a questionnaire completed by participants called the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, also known as the EPDS. A higher score on the EPDS may indicate more severe PPD symptoms.

The main question researchers want to answer in this study is:

- Do PPD symptoms change after treatment with zuranolone based on EPDS scores measured at Day 15?

Researchers will also learn more about:

* Changes in participants' EPDS scores from before treatment to Day 45, which is 30 days after treatment ends.
* How many participants breastfeed their babies while taking zuranolone
* How many participants do not start new medicine after finishing their zuranolone treatment
* How many participants take new medicines after finishing zuranolone
* How many participants already tried other medicines for their depression symptoms before joining this study
* How many participants take other medicines in general while taking zuranolone

NCT07047794,"Scapula Position and Range of Motion, Strength and Performance in Thoracic Hyperkyphosis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047794,,RECRUITING,"In the sagittal plane, the average kyphosis angle between the superior endplate of the T1 vertebra and the inferior endplate of the T12 vertebra is approximately 40 degrees. A thoracic spine angle greater than 45 degrees is defined as hyperkyphosis. The most common types of hyperkyphosis observed in juveniles and adolescents are Scheuermann's kyphosis, postural hyperkyphosis, and congenital hyperkyphosis.

Postural hyperkyphosis is the most prevalent form among these types. It results from the weakness of the muscles responsible for maintaining an upright posture and occurs due to external forces acting on the spine. The curvature of the spine in this condition is not rigid and can generally be corrected when the individual is asked to stand upright. Postural hyperkyphosis is typically seen during adolescence.

An increased thoracic kyphosis angle in postural hyperkyphosis can affect scapular kinematics, potentially leading to shoulder pathologies later in life, such as impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinopathy, rotator cuff tears, glenohumeral instability, and adhesive capsulitis. Additionally, hyperkyphosis can negatively affect body image and overall quality of life. If it begins in childhood and remains untreated, hyperkyphosis may persist into adulthood and contribute to increased healthcare expenditures. Given the growing prevalence of technology dependence and its association with rising hyperkyphosis incidence, early management of this deformity during juvenile and adolescent periods is essential in terms of both health and economic outcomes. In managing postural hyperkyphosis, it is important to address not only the angular correction of the deformity but also to consider the entire spine within the kinetic chain model.

The kinetic chain model is a biomechanical concept that defines the body as a system of interconnected segments. Any dysfunction within one segment of the kinetic chain can affect the quality of movement in both the upper and lower segments. The scapula serves as a foundation within this model, acting as a force transmitter that converts potential energy generated by muscles into kinetic energy in the upper extremity. Hyperkyphosis can lead to scapular protraction and downward rotation, disrupting the normal positioning of the scapula. As a result, joint range of motion, strength, and performance in the upper extremity may be negatively affected.

Studies in the literature have shown that scapular positioning and movements play a critical role in upper extremity function. However, no study has been found that specifically investigates the impact of altered scapular position on upper extremity performance in children with thoracic hyperkyphosis. Considering the increasing prevalence of thoracic hyperkyphosis in children due to rising technology addiction, and the potential for this deformity to contribute to upper extremity pathologies in adulthood, identifying its effects is crucial for improving children's physical performance and reducing future healthcare costs.",NO,Hyperkyphosis,OTHER: Assessment,"Sociodemographic Status, The sociodemographic status of the participants will be recorded with an evaluation form prepared by the researchers.

NCT07047781,Smartphone Addiction and Thoracic Hyperkyphosis in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047781,,RECRUITING,"Smartphones are advanced devices that have evolved beyond basic calling and messaging functions, offering features comparable to computers due to the development of mobile operating systems. In addition to their technical capabilities, smartphones have become increasingly appealing to children, adolescents, and adults through continuously updated websites, applications, and social networks that provide access to current information and opportunities for social interaction.

Excessive use of smartphones and similar technological devices can be defined as mobile phone addiction or internet addiction. The risk of smartphone addiction is particularly high among children and adolescents. The prolonged use of smartphones, which are now an integral part of daily life, may negatively affect physical capacity, including the musculoskeletal system. Previous studies have shown that increased smartphone use is associated with neck/shoulder and upper extremity/back discomfort. This increased usage can lead to non-neutral spinal postures and sustained muscular loading. Due to the central role of the spine within the kinetic chain, postural changes and muscular strain in the spine may affect movement quality in both upper and lower segments. For example, excessive neck flexion while texting can have widespread effects on spinal alignment and function. Therefore, smartphone use may cause significant changes in thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis.

Thoracic hyperkyphosis is commonly detected during adolescence and encompasses a range of spinal deformities from mild postural changes to rigid deformities accompanied by soft tissue and structural alterations. In children and adolescents, three main types of hyperkyphosis are observed: postural kyphosis, Scheuermann's kyphosis, and congenital kyphosis.

Postural hyperkyphosis is the most common type. It results from the weakness of antigravity muscles responsible for upright posture, leading to curvature of the spine under external forces. This type of curvature is not rigid and can often be corrected voluntarily when the individual is instructed to stand upright. Postural hyperkyphosis typically occurs during adolescence and is characterized by a thoracic kyphosis angle generally below 65 degrees. It is a common yet often overlooked condition in healthy adolescents and can be identified through school screenings.

Today, the growing use of smartphones and the associated rise in technology addiction have contributed to the increasing prevalence of postural hyperkyphosis, which is caused by prolonged incorrect postures. It has also been reported that postural habits developed during childhood often persist into adulthood.

If left untreated, hyperkyphosis that begins in adolescence may continue into adulthood, potentially increasing healthcare expenditures. With the rising incidence of hyperkyphosis linked to smartphone addiction, it is crucial to address this deformity beginning in adolescence, both from a health and economic perspective. Many authorities advocate for the inclusion of scoliosis and hyperkyphosis in school screening programs. However, in our country, routine screenings for skeletal system problems are not conducted in schools.

NCT07047768,Artificial Intelligence for Respiratory Infections SEverity Prediction,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047768,AIRISE,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Health Data Warehouses (HDWs) are a major resource for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to predictive and personalized medicine. We propose a project leveraging the HDW of the Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL) to study acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs), a major public health issue due to their impact on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted their burden and complexity.

ALRTIs can be caused by viral agents (e.g., influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial pathogens (e.g., pneumococcus, mycoplasma, legionella), and may be acquired in the community or during hospitalization. Given their frequency and potential severity, early identification of patients at risk of clinical deterioration is crucial, especially those likely to require intensive care.

The recent deployment of the HCL HDW now allows for the structured extraction, linkage, and storage of administrative, clinical, biological, and pharmaceutical data. This system supports the reconstruction of each patient's care trajectory and clinical history, offering new opportunities for advanced modeling.

In recent years, several predictive tools have been developed to estimate the severity or prognosis of respiratory infections, including PSI/FINE, qSOFA, CURB-65, the EPIC sepsis model, and early warning systems (EWS). The COVID-19 crisis spurred the creation of new scores and models to predict clinical outcomes or mortality, as well as online tools and apps for clinicians. However, many of these tools rely on limited datasets (often single-center or small cohorts), static variables (e.g., comorbidities), and do not consider the temporal dynamics of patient data.

Some research teams have explored the use of multicenter data and machine learning (e.g., MLHO-Machine Learning to predict Health Outcomes), notably to model COVID-19 outcomes. Nonetheless, most models lack integration of longitudinal clinical and biological data, and few are generalizable to all respiratory infections. Additionally, existing tools rarely account for real-time contextual variables such as current levels of population immunity or vaccine availability.

Our project aims to develop a dynamic AI-based detection algorithm to predict the risk of ICU admission in patients with ALRTIs. The model will be trained on retrospective HDW data from the HCL, including the evolution of vital signs, laboratory values, treatments, and demographic factors. By capturing temporal trends and clinical trajectories, our algorithm will go beyond static scoring systems and offer real-time risk stratification.

Ultimately, this algorithm could be embedded in hospital information systems as a clinical decision support tool. By generating alerts for early signs of deterioration, it would enable more timely interventions, resource optimization, and improved patient outcomes.

This approach differs from existing models in two fundamental ways. First, it covers a broad patient population with viral and bacterial pneumonia of both community and hospital origin. Second, it explicitly incorporates the longitudinal dimension of health data, allowing the model to learn from dynamic changes in patient condition. This temporal perspective is key to improving prediction accuracy and enabling early detection of deterioration.",NO,Infectious Respiratory Diseases|Hospitalized Patients|Adult Patients,OTHER: No intervention : data-based study,"Admission to intensive care unit, The primary outcome was admission to intensive care unit during the study period, Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to the emergency department and/or hospitalized in one of the Hospices Civils de Lyon departments for a respiratory infection between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024.",,

NCT07047742,Efficacy of Dietary Interventions and Educational Programs as Adjunctive Therapies for the Management of Urolithiasis: Efficacy of Fresh Lemon Juice and Roselle as Educational Program on Urolithiasis Parameters,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047742,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The Efficacy of Dietary and Health Educational Program, as Adjunctive Therapies for the Management of Urolithiasis Introduction Background Urolithiasis, commonly known as kidney stone disease, is a prevalent global health concern affecting millions of individuals annually. The incidence and recurrence of urolithiasis have been increasing due to dietary habits, metabolic disorders, and genetic predispositions (Qian et al., 2022). Kidney stones are crystalline mineral deposits that form within the urinary tract and are classified based on their chemical composition, including calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, and cystine stones (Wang et al., 2021).The condition is associated with debilitating symptoms such as renal colic, hematuria, and urinary tract obstruction, leading to significant morbidity and healthcare costs (Urolithiasis EAU Guidelines on, 2023).Conventional management strategies for urolithiasis include pharmacological treatments, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy, and surgical interventions (Fedorowicz et al., 2024). Despite these treatments, high recurrence rates highlight the necessity of preventive strategies through dietary and lifestyle modifications.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has gained increasing attention in urolithiasis prevention and management, particularly the use of herbal remedies and nutritional interventions. Citrus fruits, particularly lemon juice, have been proposed as effective dietary interventions due to their high citrate content, which inhibits stone formation (Ruggenenti et al., 2022). Additionally, Hibiscus sabdariffa (roselle) has been traditionally used for its diuretic and nephroprotective properties, suggesting potential benefits in preventing urolithiasis (Prasongwatana et al., 2018). However, while these natural interventions have shown promise, there is a lack of strong clinical evidence supporting their efficacy in reducing kidney stone formation and recurrence. Additionally, patient education is crucial in modifying lifestyle behaviors and improving adherence to preventive measures (Gamal et al., 2023). Thus, a comprehensive approach integrating dietary interventions with structured education could be more effective in managing urolithiasis.

Aim of study This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of dietary interventions (fresh lemon juice and Hibiscus sabdariffa) combined with an educational program in managing urolithiasis.

Objectives of study

This dissertation has several objectives which are listed below:

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of fresh lemon juice, in conjunction with an educational program, on the urinary stones parameters (like stone size, symptoms, infection rate, ...), as well as tracking its potential complications.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa (Roselle) in conjunction with an educational program, on the urinary stones parameters (like stone size, symptoms, infection rate, ...), as well as tracking its potential complications.
3. To determine the effectiveness of educational program on the urinary stones parameters (like stone size, symptoms, infection rate, ...)
4. To compare the outcomes among four study groups: (i) lemon juice + education, (ii) roselle tea + education, (iii) education-only, and (iv) control (no intervention).
5. Assess demographic data and clinical status, stone characteristics, lifestyle and dietary habits of participants.

The study aims to investigate whether this training increases students' knowledge and intervention competences towards disasters.

Methods: This research is a study with a quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted with 1st and 2nd year students who were studying at a university, Department of Nursing, and had not taken public health and disaster management courses. An intervention group and a control group were formed by applying tests measuring disaster awareness and disaster response self-efficacy to the students.

NCT07047261,Efficacy of a Xanthan-based Chlorhexidine Gel in the Treatment of Peri-implant Mucositis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047261,,RECRUITING,"The peri-implant mucositis is an inflammatory and reversible lesion that surrounds the peri-implant mucosa without loss of supporting bone, clinically characterized by bleeding on gentle probing. It has been estimated that it affects approximately 21% to 88% of individuals and 9% to 51% of implant sites, with prevalences of 47% and 29%, respectively.

Experimental clinical researches show that peri-implant mucositis can be reversed if proper biofilm management is maintained. Prevention and regression of inflammation around the implant can be achieved through proper oral hygiene and an effective supportive care protocol, which may include regular clinical check-ups, radiographic assessments, oral hygiene instructions and professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR).

Therefore, adjunctive measures such as self-administration of oral rinse antiseptics (i.e. chlorhexidine) may be considered. For examples, the use of a chlorhexidine-based gel in combination with xanthan (XanCHX), in addition to PMPR has demonstrated clinical improvements in the treatment of periodontitis.

NCT07047235,Substrate Remodelling and Targeted Ablation in AF,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07047235,STRATA AF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting millions worldwide and causing symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue and breathlessness. It also increases the risk of stroke and heart failure, so effective treatment is essential.

A treatment for AF involves catheter ablation, a minimally invasive procedure where problematic areas of the heart are targeted using controlled heart energy. This is done by passing wires called catheters, through blood vessels at the top of the leg all the way to the heart. However, this isn't effective for everyone and approximately half of patients experience a return of AF despite treatment.

In this researcher-led study at St Bartholomew's Hospital (paid for by Johnson \& Johnson and backed by a British Heart Foundation Intermediate Fellowship), we will used a method called electroanatomical mapping to make a 3D picture of the left atrium, the heart's upper left chamber. To make this picture more detailed, we will then collect information - such as how strong electrical signals are (voltage), how fast and in which direction they travel through the heart to describe abnormal areas and areas of scar within the heart. We will also gather information about the routes electricity takes and the nerve activity in the heart muscle. These detailed maps will help us understand why AF can continue indefinitely in some people, why ablation works for some people and not other and how to possibly improve how we do ablations to make them more effective.

All participants will undergo catheter ablation with these mapping methods integrated into the procedure. If AF recurs, patients will be invited for a second ablation targeting specific abnormal areas depending on the amount of scar found. This will be standardised across patients.

We will follow patients for 12 months, with structured visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and 48-hour ECG recorders at 6 and 12 months. By tracking how the heart's structure and electrical behaviour evolve, we aim to show that map-guided ablation reduces the need for further procedures, lowers healthcare costs and improves quality of life.

Ultimately, this study will provide clear, reproducible insights into AF mechanisms and yield practical guidance so clinicians can predict who will benefit from standard ablation treatment and who may require extra, map-guided treatment.",NO,Atrial Fibrillation (AF)|Atrial Fibrillation Mechanisms|Catheter Ablation|Low Voltage Areas,"PROCEDURE: Pulmonary vein reisolation, ganglionic plexi ablation and conduction slowing sites ablation|PROCEDURE: Pulmonary vein reisolation and ganglionic plexi ablation","Assessment of Electrical, Structural and Autonomic Remodelling in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation, A primary objective of this study is to delineate the remodelling changes that occur in persistent atrial fibrillation and to utilise these to develop tailored ablation strategies., 4 years|Establish a Predictive Model to Idenitfy Which Patients are Responders to Pulmonary Vein Isolation Alone and Who Will Require Further Tailored Ablation Strategies, Based on clinical data approximately only 50% of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who undergo pulmonary vein isolation remain in sinus rhythm.

Three structured educational sessions on menstrual health, healthy diet, and physical activity were delivered by trained female educators between May 20 and June 30, 2023, at Patuakhali Science and Technology University, Barishal University, and Khulna University. Participation was voluntary. Reinforcement follow-ups were conducted every two months for six months.

A quasi-experimental design was employed. Post-intervention data were collected from February to March 2024. Based on sample size calculations assuming a 30% reduction in disorder prevalence, 498 students (249 per group) were initially enrolled. After exclusions, 234 intervention and 238 control participants were analyzed for dysmenorrhea; 228 per group for PMS and MI. Propensity score matching (1:1, caliper 0.01, no replacement) yielded 98 matched participants per group for final analysis.

Eligible participants were female students aged ≥19 years, residing in university dormitories. Data collection used validated Bengali-language, interviewer-administered questionnaires, based on relevant literature and menstrual health IEC materials. Trained female enumerators ensured data quality and participant comfort.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the most common sleep disordered breathing. It is estimated that almost 1 billion adults have OSA worldwide.

Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, co-morbid OSA is frequently seen in patients with COPD. Co-morbid OSA has been shown to increase mortality, to reduce quality of life and to favour acute exacerbation of COPD. For those admitted for a life-threatening exacerbation of COPD requiring an intensive care admission for acute hypercapnic failure, they are more likely to get readmitted. For those admitted for an acute exacerbation in any ward, they are more likely to be re-admitted for another exacerbation within 180-days if their OSA is not treated.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that combining anti-angiogenic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly extends progression-free survival (PFS) in first-line advanced/metastatic RCC settings. To address the unmet need for adjuvant strategies in intermediate/high-risk localized RCC, we propose a synergistic approach leveraging targeted therapy and immunotherapy. This dual-modality regimen may delay resistance mechanisms while enhancing disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Vorolanib, a next-generation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), exhibits unique pharmacodynamic properties that warrant investigation in adjuvant paradigms.

The standard treatment for resectable melanomas has traditionally been surgery, often followed by adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, the emergence of neoadjuvant/perioperative therapies, administered prior to surgery, has revolutionized the management of patients with stage IIIB-C-D melanoma presenting with locoregional macroscopic metastases. Another therapeutic approach involving an intratumoral immunocytokine called DAROMUN (a fusion protein combining an antibody and a cytokine), designed to stimulate antitumor immunity within the melanoma cell microenvironment, was presented at the global oncology congress (ASCO) in June 2024. Preliminary biomarker analyses indicated that treatment with DAROMUN leads to an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ cells, suggesting immune activation within the tumor microenvironment. This molecule, recently made available through a compassionate use program on the website of the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), may be particularly beneficial for patients who experience recurrence despite prior adjuvant therapy and who have locally advanced, resectable melanoma.The team therefore aim to conduct a real-world, ambispective, multicenter study under the auspices of the Cutaneous Oncology Group (GCC) of the French Society of Dermatology (SFD), focusing on the use of DAROMUN in patients with stage IIIB-IIID locally advanced melanoma.The primary endpoint will be to assess the response rate to treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.Secondary endpoints will include: distant metastasis-free survival, pathological complete response rate, treatment safety profile, and overall survival.",NO,Injections Intralesional,OTHER: Efficay and Safety of DAROMUN on patient treated by intralesionnal injection: DAROMEL,"Objective response rate according to RECIST 1 ( Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ), Objective response rate according to RECIST 1 ( Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ), From baseline to 13 months ( september 1, 2024 to october 31, 2025)","Pathological complete response rate (macroscopic), Disappearance of the disease at the macroscopic levels, From baseline to 13 months ( september 1, 2024 to october 31, 2025)|Pathological complete response rate (microscopic), Disappearance of the disease at the microscopic levels, From baseline to 13 months ( september 1, 2024 to october 31, 2025)",

NCT07046676,Pharmacogenetics-Based Study on Individualized Use of Sodium Valproate,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07046676,,RECRUITING,"Sodium valproate (VPA) is a first-line prescription drug widely used in the treatment of epilepsy. However, in clinical applications, it has been found that there is a large individual variation in the blood concentration of VPA. In particular, excessively high blood drug concentrations can lead to various side effects, especially hepatotoxicity. Blood drug concentration monitoring can reduce the toxic and side effects of VPA to a certain extent and improve its effectiveness, but it is too cumbersome. A large number of studies have shown that the efficacy and toxic side effects of VPA are closely related to its in vivo metabolism process. The in vivo metabolism of VPA is affected by many factors, and the genetic polymorphism of drug-metabolizing enzymes is an important factor leading to differences in blood drug concentrations and affecting the dosage of VPA. The three products generated by the biotransformation of VPA by CYP450 enzymes are all related to hepatotoxicity. The formation of 4-ene-VPA is largely catalyzed by CYP2C9 and CYP2A6. Mutations in the CYP2A6 gene may be related to VPA hepatotoxicity, but there is a lack of further direct evidence. 50% of VPA in the body is acidified and metabolized into inactive products by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) through phase II conjugation reactions. However, there is evidence that the genetic polymorphism of UGT can significantly affect the blood drug concentration of metformin. Based on the above research, we selected CYP2A6, UGT1A6, etc. as candidate genes, and studied the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the individual differences of sodium valproate through association analysis, with the hope of establishing a genetic model for optimal dosage and providing new strategies for the individualized use of VPA.",NO,Epilepsy,DRUG: sodium valproate,"The blood concentration of valproic acid, The effective blood concentration of valproic acid should be maintained at 50 - 100 ug/mL., Collect data on the first patient and follow up for a period of three years.",,

The standard treatment options include radiofrequency ablation, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Not all patients are suitable however for these treatments, some lumps are too large, or the patients are not fit enough for surgery.

Thyroid artery embolization (TAE) is a new minimally invasive technique (smaller incisions / cuts and shorter recovery time) performed under light sedation. It is used by other European Thyroid Centres, but it hasn't been used in the UK. Embolization means arteries supplying the thyroid gland are blocked by injecting small occlusive particles, like very fine grains of sand that can get stuck in small spaces, preventing blood from passing through. Blocking the thyroid arteries causes the gland to shrink. This provides symptom relief or controls an overactive gland.

We aim to undertake a TAE pilot study to explore the safety of TAE in a UK patient population. We are planning to recruit 10 eligible patients.

Total scores range from -18 to +6.

A score of +6 indicates optimal cognitive performance.

A score of -4 or below is commonly used as the threshold for covert (minimal) hepatic encephalopathy., At time of polysomnography (Approximately week 4 and week 9)|Mean difference in subjective sleep quality as measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Change in PSQI as assessed prior to polysomnography after treatment with melatonin or thiamine. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used, validated self-report questionnaire that assesses subjective sleep quality over the past month. There are 7 components:

Subjective sleep quality. Sleep latency, Sleep duration, Habitual sleep efficiency, Sleep disturbances, Use of sleeping medication, Daytime dysfunction

Each component is scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty), and the component scores are summed to yield a global PSQI score.

Total scores range from 0 to 21.

A score of 0 indicates no sleep difficulty, while 21 is severe sleep difficulty

A score of 5 or greater will be used as a threshold to indicate poor sleep quality., At time of polysomnography (Approximately week 4 and week 9)|Mean difference in health related quality of life as measured by PROMIS-29 v2.0 PROPr, Change in PROMIS-29 v2.0 PROPr as assessed prior to polysomnography after treatment with melatonin or thiamine. The PROMIS-29 v2.0 (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-item profile, version 2.0) is a standardized health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument developed by the NIH. It assesses 7 domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and pain interference, plus a single pain intensity item.

The PROPr (Preference-Based Scoring System for PROMIS) is a utility score derived from PROMIS domain scores using societal preference weights. It produces a single summary measure of overall health utility suitable for economic evaluations such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Total scores range from -0.022 to 1.0.

A score of 1.0 represents full health.

A score of 0 represents a health state equivalent to death.

Scores below 0 (minimum -0.022) indicate health states con, At time of polysomnography (Approximately week 4 and week 9)|Mean change in pre-bedtime to awake salivary melatonin levels in participants after 4 weeks of treatment with melatonin or thiamine as measured at time of polysomnography, We will collect night and morning salivary melatonin levels and assess the difference between the two levels after each treatment period.

Despite significant progress in optimizing pharmacological treatment for HF patients, the personal and social burden of this disease is still characterized by debilitating symptoms and rehospitalizations. Today, many patients with heart failure use non-pharmacological methods for managing common symptoms. Due to the increased interest in non-pharmacological methods among individuals in society, it has become essential for healthcare professionals, including nurses as part of the healthcare team, to play a role in these methods to meet the health needs of the community.

Despite advances in supportive care and the approval of more than 10 new drugs since 2017, the outcomes of older adults with adverse-risk acute myeloid leukemia and other high-grade myeloid cancers remains poor. Most patients are expected to die from their cancer or the consequences of treatment-related side effects. Donor HCT is a very important part of any curative-cancer treatment for these patients. However, while accepted as standard care for decades, this treatment exposes patients to long periods of drug-induced low blood cell counts and the problems associated with low blood counts, like infections and bleeding, which are associated with significant risk of chronic side effects and death. This study will use a different approach to the upfront curative-cancer treatment of older adults with an adverse-risk AML or other high-grade myeloid cancer. This study will use intense chemotherapy followed a few days later by lower-dose TBI and donor HCT. Chemotherapy drugs, such as idarubicin, fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. G-CSF helps the bone marrow make more white blood cells in patients with low white blood cell count due to cancer treatment. This approach allows effective treatment of cancer cells and overall reduction of the period of low blood cells counts. This decreases the risk for problems associated with low blood counts, such as infection and chronic side effects. Decreasing these are important for older adults who undergo HCT. This treatment strategy may improve treatment outcomes by allowing more patients to successfully undergo donor HCT and reduce the risk of low blood cell counts and the problems associated with low blood counts. Giving chemotherapy followed immediately by reduced-intensity TBI and donor HCT may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating adults age 60 and older with newly diagnosed adverse-risk AML or other high-grade myeloid cancer.",NO,Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome,PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|DRUG: Cytarabine|PROCEDURE: Echocardiography Test|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Idarubicin|PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan|BIOLOGICAL: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor|RADIATION: Total-Body Irradiation,"Proportion of participants starting study treatment with FLAG-Ida within 42 days of the date of informed consent, Will evaluate the proportion of participants starting study treatment with FLAG-Ida within 42 days of the date of informed consent., Up to 42 days after informed consent","Number of patients transplanted, Will evaluate the number of patients transplanted., Up to 2 years|Time from day of consent to day of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), Will evaluate time from day of consent to day of allogeneic HCT., From day of consent to day of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)|Reasons for failure to undergo allogeneic transplantation (allo-HCT), Identified reasons for failure to undergo allogeneic transplantation (e.g., lack of suitable donor, complications of disease) will be systematically categorized and quantitatively reported., Up to 2 years following Screening enrollment|Incidence of adverse events, Will evaluate the number of participants with non-hematologic adverse events ≥ grade 3.

NCT07045896,Fucoidan in the Treatment of Active Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045896,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint destruction and autoantibody production. Scavenger receptor-A (SR-A), a pattern recognition receptor primarily expressed on myeloid-derived cells, is significantly elevated in the serum of RA patients. Genetic knockout of SR-A completely protects mice from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). As an SR-A inhibitor, fucoidan markedly suppresses the progression of CIA in mice. Given the potential role of SR-A in RA pathogenesis, the investigators hypothesize that fucoidan may exert therapeutic effects in RA by specifically targeting human SR-A.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of fucoidan in RA treatment through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, providing original insights into its clinical application.

NCT07045831,"The LYMPH Trial - Surgical Versus Conservative Complex Physical Decongestion Therapy for Chronic Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema: A Pragmatic, Randomized, Multicenter Superiority Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045831,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Title:

The LYMPH Trial - Microsurgical versus Conservative Therapy for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema

Purpose of the Study:

The LYMPH trial compares two treatments for chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL)-a condition where fluid builds up and causes swelling, usually in the arm, after breast cancer treatment.

The study is testing whether microsurgical treatments (lymphatic surgery) are more effective than the current conservative therapy (called CDT) in improving quality of life for women with this condition.

What is BCRL? After surgery or radiotherapy for breast cancer, some women develop swelling in the arm (lymphedema) due to damaged lymphatic vessels. This condition can cause pain, heaviness, infections, reduced mobility, and emotional distress. It can also impact daily activities and work life.

Treatment Approaches:

Conservative Decongestion Therapy (CDT):

Includes manual lymphatic drainage (massage), compression bandaging/garments, skin care, and exercise.

It is currently the standard treatment, but it's time-consuming, lifelong, and does not cure the condition.

Microsurgical Treatment:

Lymphovenous Anastomosis (LVA): Creates tiny bypasses between lymphatic vessels and veins to drain excess fluid.

Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer (VLNT): Transfers healthy lymph nodes to the affected area to help restore drainage.

Sometimes liposuction is added to remove built-up fat caused by long-term lymphedema.

These surgeries aim to fix the underlying problem, not just manage the symptoms.

How the Study Works:

Participants:

280 women aged 18 or older who have had breast cancer and suffer from chronic BCRL.

Groups:

Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups:

Group A: Receives lymphatic surgery. Group B: Continues with CDT.

Follow-Up:

All participants are followed for 2 years, with some follow-up continuing for up to 10 years. They complete questionnaires about quality of life, pain, arm swelling, and daily impact.

Crossover Option:

After the main follow-up (15 months), women in the CDT group may choose to switch to surgical treatment.

Goals and Benefits:

The main goal is to see whether women who have surgery report better quality of life than those who continue with CDT.

Other goals include measuring pain, arm swelling, infections, and the impact on daily life and costs.

This study also hopes to support broader access to lymphatic surgery, as many health insurers currently do not cover it.

Safety and Ethics:

All treatments are already used in clinical practice.

Risks of surgery (like infection or bleeding) are rare and manageable.

The study meets international ethical and safety standards.

Where is the Study Taking Place? The study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, including Belgium.

Why This Matters:

Chronic BCRL can have a serious impact on daily life and emotional well-being. By comparing two valid treatment options in a high-quality scientific study, this trial hopes to identify the most effective and sustainable way to help women live better after breast cancer.",NO,Lymphedema Arm,PROCEDURE: Microsurgical Lymphatic Reconstruction (Lymphovenous Anastomosis (LVA) and/or Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer (VLNT))|OTHER: Conservative Complex Physical Decongestion Therapy (CDT),"Lymphedema-specific Quality of Life (QoL) at 15 months, Change in lymphedema-specific quality of life from baseline to 15 months post-randomization, measured using the Lymph-ICF-UL questionnaire (Upper Limb Module).

However, most survivors live with harsh side effects due to cancer and its treatments. While international guidelines recommend involving physiotherapists (PTs) in cancer care, many countries do not provide access to these services as a standard part of treatment. Healthcare navigators help patients overcome barriers and streamline care which has shown to improve clinical processes while reducing clinical and patient costs. Through ongoing and routine assessment, a PT Navigator could specifically address issues like fatigue and strength loss, refer patients to other needed services, and help set goals to improve quality of life. Currently, there are no PT Navigator roles in acute cancer care settings in Canada. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a PT Navigator role for individuals living with cancer receiving cancer treatment.

Methods:

Participants will include adults recently diagnosed with cancer who are/will be receiving cancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy), are English-speaking and community dwelling. Participants in the intervention group will be followed by the PT Navigator for 12-18 weeks who will screen for early side effects of cancer and its treatment and respond or refer accordingly. Participants in the control group will continue with usual care.

Outcomes: Participants will be assessed at 3 time points. The primary outcome is adherence. Secondary outcomes include other feasibility measures such as retention, recruitment, satisfaction, and preliminary effectiveness will be assessed using overall impairment score, self-reported exercise volume, quality of life, health care utilization, exercise capacity and physical function.

CAR-T therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. Large numbers of the CAR-T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. While CAR-T therapy is commonly used to treat multiple myeloma, it can result in toxicities that lead to hospitalization, nerve and muscle impairment, and decreased physical function. Prehabilitation programs use targeted interventions to improve functional status prior to medical or surgical treatments. In this study, patients participate in personalized aerobic and resistance prehabilitation activities in the weeks leading up to their CAR-T infusion.

NCT07045714,Bilateral Lumbar Decompression Via Uniportal Endoscopic Laminotomy in Patients With Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: Multicentric Case Series,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045714,MELD-1,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition that can cause pain, sensory disturbances, and motor deficits due to the compression of neural structures in the lumbar spine. While conservative treatments such as physical therapy and pain management can help some patients, others with persistent neurological deficits may require surgical intervention. Traditional surgical approaches, including open laminectomy, have proven effective but carry risks such as extensive muscle damage, considerable blood loss, postoperative spinal instability, and prolonged recovery times.

This study evaluates a minimally invasive surgical approach called unilateral laminotomy with bilateral lumbar decompression (ULBLD) using endoscopic uniportal technique as an alternative to traditional methods for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. The main objective is to assess changes in neurological deficits and disability in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis following this procedure. The study will also document hospitalization duration, surgical time, blood loss, and the incidence of postoperative complications.

This multicenter, prospective case series will recruit 78 patients from three medical centers in Mexico. Participants must have symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis that persists despite at least three months of conservative treatment. Eligible patients will undergo ULBLD using endoscopic uniportal technique, a method that allows precise nerve decompression through a small incision, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. Standardized clinical assessment tools, including the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale for lumbar disease, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, will be used to evaluate outcomes at multiple time points over 12 months.

By comparing patients' preoperative and postoperative evaluations, the study aims to determine whether ULBLD using endoscopic uniportal technique effectively improves neurological function and reduces disability while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Findings from this study could lead to a more precise understanding of the impact of ULBLD on disability, pain, and health-related quality of life for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.",NO,Spinal Stenosis Lumbar,PROCEDURE: Unilateral Laminotomy with Bilateral Lumbar Decompression (ULBLD),"Change in Lumbar Disability (Oswestry Disability Index), This measure assesses disability related to lumbar pain using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), a validated instrument scored from 0% (no disability) to 100% (maximum disability).

In addition, HF is the most frequent hospital diagnosis in the elderly, and is the main cause of hospitalization, with significant expenditure in public and private health care worldwide. Some functional tests have been used to predict the prognosis in patients with HF, however, the use of the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (SST1) to predict prognosis in HF has little scientific evidence, due to the lack of studies found in the literature for this population. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the association between SST1 at discharge from the Cardio Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the clinical outcome after 90 days in patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure (DHF). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study analyzing the association between performance on the TSL1 and clinical outcome in patients hospitalized for DHF from June 2025 to October 2025. Sociodemographic, family, social, and clinical data will be collected from the participants, after which the TSL1 will be performed. The outcome of death and hospital readmission within 90 days after discharge from the ICU will be identified through telephone contact, which will be carried out by the researcher.

NCT07045610,Primary Resistance Mechanisms of ALK TKIs,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045610,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement is a known oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been clearly shown to produce excellent therapeutic effects and prolong survival in patients with this gene mutation. According to current treatment guidelines, ALK inhibitors are the first-line treatment of choice for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients. However, although ALK TKIs are very effective, there is still a small group of patients who do not achieve good treatment outcomes, developing resistance and tumor progression within 3 to 6 months of initial ALK TKI use. This is called primary resistance. Intrinsic resistance to ALK inhibition occurs when the best clinical response after first-generation and second/third-generation TKI treatment is disease progression. Approximately 5-7% of cases after crizotinib treatment, 9% after ceritinib treatment, and 25% after lorlatinib treatment show no response to treatment, and no specific ALK mutation has been found to explain the occurrence of primary resistance. Currently, many different resistance mechanisms are known, some of which are still ALK-related, while others are ALK-independent alternative survival pathways. However, most research focuses on acquired resistance, with very few studies on primary resistance, only a few case reports. Therefore, this study aims to explore the primary ALK TKI resistance mechanisms.

The investigators plan to explore the incidence and mechanisms of primary ALK TKI resistance in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients who develop primary resistance or rapid progression (within 3-6 months) during ALK inhibitor treatment by re-obtaining tumor samples for genetic analysis.",NO,ALK-positive Advanced NSCLC Patients|Primary Resistance|NGS,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: re-biopsy tumor with primary ALK tKI resistance for NGS,"resistance mechanism, Lung cancer patients who initially use ALK TKI as first-line treatment will be invited to enroll and sign the consent form.

1. Burden:

   Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are a major public health problem, primarily affecting children. Although STH prevalence has decreased to 14% in Bangladesh, over 47 million preschool- and school-age children still live in high-risk areas.
2. Knowledge gap:

   Albendazole shows 94-100% efficacy against A. lumbricoides but only 39-60% against T. trichuria. Ivermectin is also effective against hookworm and T. trichuria. Combining ivermectin with albendazole may be more effective than using either drug alone, but this combined therapy for STH has not yet been studied in Bangladesh.
3. Relevance:

STHs significantly impact children's nutrition, hindering health, growth, cognition, and learning. The national deworming program achieved 98.3% treatment coverage, but only 76.2% of PSAC were dewormed using self-prescribed medicines.

Hypothesis (if any):

The combination therapy of Albendazole and Ivermectin is more effective than Albendazole alone for treating soil-transmitted helminths in preschool-age children in Bangladesh

Objectives:

1. To compare the safety and efficacy of Albendazole and Ivermectin combination therapy with Albendazole monotherapy in preschool-aged children
2. To evaluate post-treatment egg reduction rates for various helminths at different time points
3. To determine the median time to re-infection following different anti-helminth interventions for various STH

Methods:

This Phase IIa single-blinded, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ivermectin and albendazole combination therapy versus standard albendazole monotherapy for STH in 2-5 years in rural Belkuchi, Sirajganj. A total of 110 PSAC with confirmed STH will be randomly assigned to two treatment arms. Field activities and laboratory analysis will use the Kato-Katz technique for microscopic examination.

What is the effect of remimazolam on consciousness, as measured by the MOAA/S scale and Narcotrend monitoring during anesthesia? Researchers will compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of remimazolam to see if the drug provides consistent and predictable sedation without significant adverse effects.

Participants will:

Receive continuous Infusion of Remimazolam. Have blood samples taken at various time points to measure plasma concentrations and calculate PK parameters.

Be monitored for consciousness and sedation levels using the MOAA/S scale and Narcotrend.

Undergo safety assessments, including laboratory tests, vital signs monitoring, and physical examinations throughout the study.

This study will help determine the drug's behavior in the body and its impact on sedation, providing valuable information for its future clinical use in anesthesia and other medical applications.

NCT07045428,68Ga-GP-01 Injection in Solid Tumors Participants,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045428,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"A company named Chengdu Shetai Medical Technology Co., Ltd. is conducting a research study to test a new type of scan for detecting solid tumors in patients who are scheduled for surgery.

During the scan, the investigators will use a special experimental drug called 68Ga-GP-01 Injection, which is given through a vein (IV). This drug isn't yet approved by the TGA for this use.

The scan works by targeting a protein called FAP that's often found in high amounts in tumor tissues. FAP is mainly present in cells surrounding tumors, but sometimes in cancer cells themselves too - especially in certain cancers like ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and some sarcomas. Researchers think this could be useful for both diagnosis and potential future treatments.

The GP-01 molecule is combined with a radioactive material (Gallium-68) that shows up on PET scans - a special imaging technique that can spot cancer cells in the body.

Currently, CT scans are the most common way to check for tumors before surgery. A PET/CT machine combines both technologies - it can show both the structure of participant's organs (CT) and detect cancer cells that have absorbed the radioactive tracer (PET).

In this study, the investigators want to see if 68Ga-GP-01 works better than standard PET/CT scans at finding tumors. After participant's surgery, the investigators will compare our scan results with participant's pathology report (the most accurate way to diagnose cancer) to check how accurate our method was.

Important: This is NOT a treatment for participant's cancer - it's just testing a new way to detect tumors.

NCT07045415,The Effect of Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises After Radical Prostatectomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07045415,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cancer, a major public health problem worldwide, was one of the leading causes of mortality in 2020, accounting for approximately 10 million deaths. With 1.41 million new cases reported in the same year, prostate cancer is the fourth most common cancer type globally (Ferlay et al., 2021). Prostate cancer is not only one of the most common types of cancer in men, but it also ranks second among cancer-related deaths in men worldwide (Rahnama'i et al., 2021). Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a treatment method that involves the surgical removal of the prostate gland and surrounding tissues, to stop the progression of the disease and improve the patient's quality of life (Göktas et al., 2015; Litwin and Tan, 2017). Following radical prostatectomy, a curative treatment method commonly used to prevent metastasis, mortality rates remain low; however, the procedure carries a relatively high risk of morbidity (Akarken et al., 2020; Evren and Taşcı, 2021).

The most common complication encountered by patients after RP is urinary incontinence (Choiniere et al., 2022; Rahnama'i et al., 2021). UI arises due to factors such as damage to the internal sphincter, external rhabdosphincter, and supportive structures of the urethra during surgery, as well as the involvement of the neurovascular bundle and the development of postoperative fibrosis (Castellan et al., 2023). Urinary incontinence (UI) developing after radical prostatectomy significantly reduces patients' quality of life and negatively affects their social adaptation. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing the development of UI after radical prostatectomy is of great importance in determining appropriate treatment approaches and optimizing management (Bernardes et al., 2019; Storås et al., 2020). In the literature, the incidence rates of incontinence after radical prostatectomy range from 0.8% to 87%, and these differences are attributed to various factors such as surgical technique, patient characteristics, and evaluation methods (Boorjian et al., 2012; Hodges et al., 2019; Grise et al., 2017; Pastero et al., 2017).

In the majority of patients, moderate to severe urinary incontinence is observed in the first few weeks after surgery. In some patients, this condition may persist for months or even years. Urinary incontinence can lead to various psychosocial effects such as shame, loss of self-esteem, impaired mental well-being, anxiety, relationship and sexual dysfunction, and social isolation (Kadono et al., 2016; Zachovajeviene et al., 2017). This condition has a significant impact on patients' physical, social, and emotional well-being, as well as their daily activities, and can contribute to social isolation by causing feelings of embarrassment (Castellan et al., 2023; Ouanes et al., 2022).

Nurses play an important role in the management of urinary incontinence that develops after RP. Nurses can educate patients about urinary incontinence, teach conservative treatment methods such as pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME), and provide psychological support to make the process more manageable (Milios et al., 2019; Tosunöz et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). PBME is an effective method that stands out in the rehabilitation of incontinence after RP, and it is one of the most common practices aimed at increasing the strength of the pelvic floor muscles to eliminate sphincter weakness (Castellan et al., 2023; Chitre and Kulkarni, 2023; Pratiwi et al., 2020). Studies on the effectiveness of PTKE indicate that these exercises can improve patients' urinary control (Azal et al., 2022). Nurses play a significant role in promoting pelvic floor muscle health by providing information and implementing educational programs and practices to ensure that these exercises are taught and performed correctly (Jalalinia et al., 2020; Storås et al., 2020).

This study aims to evaluate the effects of preoperative and postoperative nursing interventions on urinary incontinence management and quality of life in patients who have undergone RP. In this context, the effects of nursing interventions (education, pelvic floor muscle exercises, bladder training, etc.) on urinary incontinence severity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction will be examined comparatively. The study aims to identify the most effective nursing interventions in the management of urinary incontinence after RP and to integrate these interventions into clinical practice.",NO,Prostate Cancer (Post Prostatectomy)|Urinary Incontinence (UI),BEHAVIORAL: Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises.,"Change in Urinary Incontinence Severity Assessed by ICIQ-SF, The primary outcome is the change in urinary incontinence severity following pelvic floor muscle exercises in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.

More than 40% of hospitalized patients with HF have diabetes mellitus (DM), which increases the risk of recurrent hospitalizations for HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction by more than two-fold. Current methods for assessing glycemic control do not consider fluctuations in blood glucose levels, known as glycemic variability. High glycemic variability is a poor prognostic marker for HF re-hospitalizations. Given the significant prevalence and impact of DM in individuals with HF, it is crucial to examine whether improving glycemic control and avoiding hypoglycemia could lead to a decrease in HF readmissions. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM), which provides glucose measurements as frequently as every 5 minutes, has improved glycemic control in insulin-treated adults with DM compared to the standard of care, capillary point-of-care blood glucose testing (POC).

SPPB, which is frequently used in elderly individuals in the literature, consists of the categories of static balance, 4-meter walking test, and 5-times sit-to-stand test (Corsonello, 2012 ). The balance test in SPPB includes three different postures: side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem. Each posture is held for up to 10 seconds. The ability to maintain these positions gives an idea about the individual's balance abilities (Cisternas, 2024). It is emphasized in the literature that the balance test, together with other components of SPPB, can predict all-cause mortality (Pahor, 2014). In our research, SPPB will be used to evaluate the static balance ability, walking speed, functional capacity,, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a widely accepted functional gait tool for assessing the risk of falls and functional stability while walking in the elderly (Shumway-Cook et al., 2013). In the literature, DGI is used as a valid, reliable, cheap and fast tool to assess the gait and balance of elderly individuals (Alghwiri, 2014). It consists of eight items including normal walking on level ground, walking with speed changes, walking with horizontal head movements, walking with vertical head movements, walking with pivot turns, walking by jumping over obstacles, taking steps around obstacles and climbing up and down stairs. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (severe impairment) to 3 (independent walking). The maximum total score can be 24.

It is noteworthy that digital hand dynamometer is frequently used to assess muscle strength in exercise studies conducted on elderly individuals (Fuchs, 2024). The measurement begins by placing the electronic and/or mechanical sensors perpendicular to the pivot point of the extremity to be tested. The measurement is made by having the tested person exert maximum effort against the device during the measurement and the tester responding to this effort with maximum force in the opposite direction in order to prevent movement (Garcia, 2020). Each measurement will be repeated twice for the right and left extremities and the results obtained will be recorded in pounds (Ib)., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Reaction speed assessment, Reaction speed is the time between the stimulus reaching the central nervous system, its evaluation and the appropriate response after the relevant arrangements are made (Davranche, 2006). With aging, the capacity of the nervous system to process information and activate a response decreases. These factors affect the quality of life of older adults and reduce their active participation. In our research, the Light Trainer Flash Light Exercise System, Reaction X device used in the literature for reaction speed assessment will be used (Erdoğanoğlu, 2024). The reaction time of the dominant hand and free hand will be recorded and the accuracy percentage will be calculated by video analysis of the test performance., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, The Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), introduced to the literature by Tinetti in 1986, is frequently used to assess balance and gait in elderly individuals and to assess the risk of falls in individuals with conditions affecting balance and gait (Tinetti, 1986). POMA, whose Turkish validity and reliability were conducted by Ağırcan, will be used in our research for the comprehensive assessment of gait and balance (Ağırcan, 2009). Permissions from the authors are provided as an attachment., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Berg Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Test (BBS), one of the frequently used tests in balance assessment in elderly individuals, has a test-retest reliability with an ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) of 0.91 and high inter-rater reliability with an ICC of 0.97 (Neuls, 2011). BBS, which consists of 14 different tasks or activities, is scored from 0 to 4 for tasks such as sitting to standing, standing without support, sitting without support, etc. The total score varies between 0 and 56, with a high score being interpreted as better balance. The scale, which was validated in Turkish by Şahin and colleagues, shows a high risk of falling, a score of 0 to 20 indicates a moderate risk of falling, a score of 21 to 40 indicates a moderate risk of falling, and a score of 41 to 56 indicates a low risk of falling (Sahin, 2008)., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 8 weeks|Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale is one of the scales used to measure enjoyment in physical activity.

Despite this high injury prevalence, there is no evidence to support some of the currently used therapeutic strategies. Amongst them, thermal therapies and especially cryotherapy modalities (Ice, Cold water immersion, perfused garments) have been extensively used on soft tissue injuries to reduce pain perception and decrease inflammation. However, recent findings in humans and in animals have reported conflictual results on the effects of cold on muscle regeneration. On the other hand, recent studies in humans suggest that passive heat exposure can impact positively muscle protein synthesis, mitochondrial content and muscle torque in injured, immobilized and healthy participants. Furthermore, preliminary results from our group have shown a faster removal of muscle damages from the muscle and suggest a better muscle regeneration after a localized heat exposure. As such, our preliminary results confirmed that local heating may represent a promising tool to accelerate muscle regeneration.

NCT07044804,Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation to Improve Language in Down Syndrome.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07044804,,RECRUITING,"Down syndrome (DS) is associated with cognitive deficits, caused by alterations in neuroplasticity and synaptic transmission. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can modulate the brain's plasticity mechanisms and neurotransmitter balance.

Anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability by depolarizing neurons, while cathodal tDCS decreases it through hyperpolarization. When combined with cognitive training, tDCS may produce faster and longer-lasting therapeutic effects. Although most of the neurorehabilitation studies have applied anodal excitatory stimulation, recent evidence suggests the potential cathodal inhibitory stimulation in neurodevelopmental disorders with alteration of synaptic transmission, as people with DS. Potentially both anodal and cathodal stimulation protocols could lead to positive clinical effects in DS.

This proof-of-concept study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy of two active tDCS protocols (anodal and cathodal) targeting the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) versus sham stimulation tDCS, combined with speech and language training, to improve language skills in adolescents and young adults with DS. The study also aims to identify the most effective parameters of tDCS treatment, for customization in adolescents and young adults with DS. Thirty-six participants, aged 12 to 21 years, will be randomly assigned to three groups receiving anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS. Each participant will undergo 10 sessions of tDCS at 1 mA for 20 minutes, alongside speech and language training five times for two weeks.

Neuropsychological, behavioral, biomarker (including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurofilament light chain), and electroencephalogram assessments will be performed at baseline, post-treatment, and three months after treatment completion. The study hypothesizes that tDCS will enhance language abilities, particularly expressive vocabulary, and modulate biomarkers of brain plasticity in DS participants. The study also hypothesizes that tDCS will enhance other cognitive and behavioral functions. Since tDCS effects may last, the study will check for improvements at the three-month.

NCT07044778,"Prevalence And Risk Factors of Overactive Bladder Syndrome Among Egyptian Medical Students, and Their Impact On Health-Related Quality Of Life",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07044778,,COMPLETED,"Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as sudden, urgent desire to urinate (urgency) accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgent urinary incontinence in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI). This condition can significantly decrease the quality of life of these patients, as it can humiliate their actions, affect their relationships with others, and it can also affect their productivity. Due to all these effects, several studies have linked the increase in overactive bladder symptoms with an increase in anxiety and depression rates. A recent cross-sectional study in the UK and Sweden, called EpiLUTS, included 10,000 participants. the investigators found a statistically significant increase in anxiety and depression rates among both men and women in both the UK and Sweden, with a slight increase in men than women On the other hand, there are several risk factors such as overweight, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. In a previous cross-sectional study in Jordan, the investigators found a correlation between an increase in risk factors such as age group, history of trauma, stressful life, and medication, and overactive bladder symptoms among medical students.

Several studies have assessed the prevalence of overactive bladder among different population age groups, ethnicities, or genders with varying results. It was rated to be 11.8% in a multicenter cross-sectional study including several countries in Canada and Europe (Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the UK), while in the USA it was estimated to be 16%. All these studies were conducted on the general population; however, in China, it was about 6% among university students.

In the Arab world, several cross-sectional studies have also assessed the prevalence of overactive bladder, including students, and its effect on the quality of life. Hajjar 2022 assessed its prevalence among Lebanese female nulliparae university students. They showed that nocturia and frequency were the most common symptoms that bothered students. the investigators also found a statistical correlation between smoking, drinking coffee, or tea, and increased symptoms. Also, drinking soft drinks was associated with an increase in urinary leakage. Additionally, Abuorouq 2024 and Shawahna 2021 conducted Cross-sectional studies were conducted on medical students in Jordan and Palestine, respectively. They reported a prevalence of 44.5% and 54.1%, respectively. Shawahna 2021 reported a statistically significant correlation between gender or stressful life and a decrease in quality of life.

Rational In Egypt, the prevalence of overactive bladder is underestimated. A single previous multinational cross-sectional study across several Arab countries, including Egypt, was conducted. was conducted in Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, and Lebanon among women. the investigators reported a prevalence of 57.5% among Egyptian women.

NCT07044661,Effect of Bilateral vs. Unilateral Alveolar Recruitment on Gas Exchange in Lung Resection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07044661,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"""One-lung ventilation (OLV) is an essential technique during thoracic surgery but preventing atelectasis during OLV remains a key challenge in thoracic anesthesia.

Several previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) can significantly reduce driving pressure, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and anatomical dead space. However, the optimal method for implementing ARMs has not yet been standardized, as the timing and target of ARM application vary among studies. Some protocols involve applying ARMs to both lungs immediately prior to the initiation of OLV (bilateral ARM), while others apply ARMs solely to the non-operative lung after OLV has begun (unilateral ARM). Bilateral ARM may provide prolonged improvement in gas exchange but carry the risk of insufficient collapse of the operative lung. Conversely, unilateral ARM may facilitate better collapse of the operative lung compared to bilateral ARMs, though potentially at the expense of gas exchange. To date, no study has directly compared these two approaches. This study aims to compare and evaluate the effects of bilateral versus unilateral ARM performed immediately prior to thoracic incision on intraoperative gas exchange and the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications.""",NO,Lung Cancer Requiring Surgical Resection Under One-lung Ventilation,PROCEDURE: Unilateral ARM|PROCEDURE: Bilateral ARM,"PaO₂/FiO₂ at 60 minutes after ARM, We analyze whether different methods of ARM result in significant differences in the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio measured at 60 minutes after the initiation of one-lung ventilation (OLV60)., PaCO₂ is assessed by arterial blood gas analysis at 60 minutes after ARM.",,

Precise repair of the OMC fractures needs a quite understanding of the regional anatomy, precise diagnosis, an accessible exposure and an accurate rigid fixation of fracture to restore the normal form. The esthetic results are one of the most important requirements for this incision in the facial fracture reduction. conventional approaches to the infraorbital rim/orbital floor include (subciliary mid lower eyelid, or subtarsal) and infraorbital incisions. A thorough understanding of each incisional technique requires an appreciation of the relevant anatomy putting in considerations the risk of associated complications.

This condition is naturally age-related and exacerbated by traumatic events, lifestyle factors, and individual genetic susceptibilities. Treatment for advanced disc degeneration typically involves surgery (spinal fusion) aimed at addressing and fusing the affected intervertebral discs using an interbody implant combined with a bone graft.

Although the use of interbody implants promotes temporary fusion, long-term success largely depends on the bone substitute used, with failure rates ranging from 10 to 20% (unsuccessful fusion, persistent symptoms, need for reoperation). Historically, autologous bone grafting was the standard, but it carries disadvantages related to pain and invasiveness. Synthetic, bioactive bone substitutes are now used, although their effectiveness varies.

Studies have shown that the incidence of AKI aftercardiopulmonary bypass surgeryranges between 5% and 30%.

The Renal Resistive Index, measured by Doppler ultrasonography, is an increasingly utilized parameter that provides valuable insights into renal hemodynamics and vascular resistance. A normal RRI is typically below 0.70; elevated values may indicate increased renal vascular resistance or microvascular damage. Bossard et al. demonstrated that increased RRI in the early postoperative period is associated with the development of AKI. Early evaluation of renal blood flow thus facilitates prompt detection of AKI. Both preoperative and postoperative RRI measurements are considered useful tools for identifying early renal dysfunction.

NCT07043673,Plasma Concentrations of the Non-protein-bound Form of Vancomycin,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043673,FREEVANCO,COMPLETED,"In routine practice, the use of vancomycin must be accompanied by plasma concentration monitoring to ensure that pharmacodynamic targets are met and that plasma concentrations are not in toxic ranges.

Because vancomycin has high plasma protein binding and a free fraction exhibits marked inter-individual variability, this variability is increased in intensive care, monitoring is all the more imperative.

The factors influencing the concentration and/or free fraction of vancomycin are numerous and vary from one study to another. The striking fact of this work is that the link between the concentration of the total form and the concentration of the free form has not been established.

However, only plasma measurements of the total form of vancomycin are currently available to clinicians in routine practice, while only the free fraction is biologically active, responsible for its efficacy, but also for its toxicity in the event of an overdose. This paradox is widely highlighted by authors who have studied the free fraction of vancomycin, emphasizing the importance of continuing scientific research on this subject. Moreover, these studies are few in number, particularly in intensive care units, and their sample size is small, and they present biases, particularly those related to their essentially retrospective nature.

The failure to consider the free concentration of vancomycin in the therapeutic monitoring strategy is primarily explained by the fact that clinicians do not have access to plasma concentrations of the free form of drugs in routine practice. Thus, the guidelines do not include pharmacodynamic targets for the free concentration, due to the lack of scientific data on the subject.",NO,Plasma Concentration,,"Measurement of plasma concentration of the free form of vancomycin, The primary endpoint is determined by the measurement of the plasma concentration of the free form of vancomycin during the total plasma concentration measurement after at least 24 hours of continuous infusion treatment., 24 hours after the start of continuous vancomycin infusion treatment","Measurement of the fraction of the non-protein-bound form of vancomycin in plasma, The fraction unbound to plasma proteins (free form) of vancomycin will be determined by the ratio of the concentration of the free form to that of the total form, and expressed as a %., 24 hours|To determine the areas under the 24-hour curve (AUC24h) for total plasma protein-bound forms of vancomycin, The area under the 24-hour plasma concentration curve (AUC24h) is calculated for vancomycin by the product of the plasma concentration times 24, due to continuous administration.

NCT07043660,Preliminary Efficacy of AdoptMindful2Care: A Pilot RCT With Adoptive Parents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043660,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Adoptive parents often face additional challenges related to the adoption process, which can increase their vulnerability to parenting stress and negatively affect their parenting practices and overall family well-being. These risks highlight the urgent need to implement post-adoption interventions that reduce parenting stress and promote both parental well-being and positive parenting practices.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of AdoptMindful2Care, a new 8-week, face-to-face, group-based psychological intervention grounded in the principles of mindful parenting. This pilot randomized controlled trial, which uses a two-arm design, serves as a preliminary step before conducting the full-scale RCT planned for AdoptMindful2Care.

We will invite both mothers and fathers to participate if they have at least one adoptive child between the ages of 2 and 17 and if the legal adoption decree was finalized in court at least 12 months before enrollment. We will target parents who report moderate to high levels of parenting stress. With the support of all Portuguese governmental adoption agencies, we plan to recruit a minimum of 78 families.

After parents express interest in participating, we will screen them to assess their levels of parenting stress. For those who meet the initial criteria, we will conduct a structured clinical interview (SCID-5-CV) to rule out severe mental illness. If they meet all inclusion criteria and present no exclusion criteria, we will proceed with a final interview to guide them through the informed consent process.

We will randomly assign eligible participants to either the intervention group (AdoptMindful2Care) or a waitlist control group (who will receive the intervention after the study concludes). All participants will be informed that they will be randomized to one of the study groups and that they will only be included if they give informed consent to participate in the study. We will deliver the intervention in person, in a group format, through eight weekly sessions and one follow-up session, each lasting approximately 90 minutes.

The goal of this observational study is to learn how well changes seen under a special microscope called a trichoscope (used to look at hair and scalp) match the success of treatment in children and adolescents with a scalp fungal infection called tinea capitis. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Do changes in trichoscopic findings show when the fungal infection is cured?

Does having more severe trichoscopic findings at the start mean that treatment will take longer or be less successful?

Do different fungus types respond differently to the same treatment?

Participants will:

Be between the ages of 0 and 18 with confirmed tinea capitis based on lab tests (microscopy and/or culture)

Receive an oral antifungal medicine called terbinafine for 4 weeks (dosing based on weight)

Attend regular checkups every 4 weeks until both scalp appearance and lab tests show the infection is gone

At each visit, participants will:

Have their scalp examined using a trichoscope

Provide scalp samples for fungal testing

Be assessed for symptoms like itching, redness, and scaling

TARE is contraindicated if LSF \>20%, and may be used with caution if LSF is 10-20%.

Findings associated with high LSF include large tumors, hepatic vein invasion, TIPS, and dysmorphic intratumoral vessels. In contrast, small (\<7 cm) mCRC tumors without hepatic vein invasion or dysmorphic vessels show consistently low LSF (\<5%).

TARE delivers radioactive microspheres (20-60 µm) to tumors via abnormal vasculature, while normal liver sinusoids (\<15 µm) block their passage. However, microspheres may enter hepatic veins and reach the lungs, risking radiation pneumonitis. To prevent this, pre-procedural angiography and MAA-based nuclear imaging assess the lung shunt fraction (LSF). TARE is contraindicated if LSF \>20% and used cautiously if 10-20%.

Large tumors, hepatic vein invasion, TIPS, and dysmorphic intratumoral vessels suggest high LSF. Dysmorphic vessels are rare in IHCC, an adenocarcinoma with typically low vascularity. Based on 10 years of data from Seoul National University Hospital, IHCC \<7 cm without vein invasion or dysmorphic vessels consistently shows LSF \<5%, with no cases of radiation pneumonitis. Thus, ""streamlining TARE""-omitting nuclear imaging-is safely performed in this population to reduce procedural delays.

NCT07043244,The Effect of Virtual Reality-Based Occupational Health and Safety Training on Workplace Accidents and Occupational Health Literacy Among Adolescents in Vocational Education,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043244,no one,COMPLETED,"In Türkiye, Vocational Education Centers (VECs) provide apprenticeship and mastery training as well as vocational course programs under the regulation of the Ministry of National Education. These centers aim to equip learners with practical and theoretical skills aligned with labor market needs. In VECs, students receive theoretical education one to two days per week, while spending four to five days receiving hands-on vocational training at workplaces. As part of this structure, students are insured against occupational accidents and diseases and receive 30% of the minimum wage. Currently, approximately 1.5 million students are enrolled in VECs, with an employment rate of 88%, significantly higher than that of vocational high schools (55%).

The Motor Vehicles Technology field is one of the most populated programs in VECs. Türkiye's rapid advancement in the automotive industry has heightened the demand for a qualified workforce in this area. According to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Türkiye recognizes every person under 18 years as a child. However, the labor force participation rate among children aged 15-17 has risen to 22.1%. These children often work long hours under unfavorable conditions. Reports indicate that children working in automotive technology suffer from musculoskeletal issues, lack tetanus vaccination, and do not utilize personal protective equipment.

Despite Türkiye's ratification of international conventions addressing child labor, the prevalence of child labor and related adverse social and health consequences remain a challenge. Occupational accidents are alarmingly high among child workers. One critical factor in reducing such incidents is improving Occupational Health Literacy (OHL), defined as the capacity of workers to access, understand, and use information and services to make informed decisions regarding workplace health and safety.

This project aims to reduce work-related accidents and improve the OHL levels of child workers in the Motor Vehicles Technology field through a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation-based occupational health and safety education program. VR simulation provides a three-dimensional, interactive learning environment where users can explore and engage with simulated scenarios. VR is particularly suitable for demonstrating hazardous, costly, or complex processes that are difficult to replicate in classroom settings. According to literature, VR-based learning yields better educational outcomes compared to traditional methods, offering cost-effectiveness, efficient space use, and opportunities for self-directed learning.

The proposed program integrates VR simulations designed to present realistic workplace hazards and safety practices. Through immersive interaction, the program seeks to enhance learners' awareness and behavioral competence regarding occupational risks.

NCT07043231,Evaluation of Creative Materials Supporting Healthcare Professionals in Discussing Suicidality in Children and Adolescents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043231,,RECRUITING,"Preliminary research clearly indicates a significant shortage of evidence-based tools and interventions specifically targeting suicidality among children and adolescents. The need for such methodologies is substantial, as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are relatively common within this age group. According to the 2022 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, 16% of boys and 28% of girls aged 13 to 18 reported having had suicidal thoughts on two or more occasions in their lifetime (Schrijvers et al., 2023). Compared to the previous HBSC study conducted in 2018, this represents a negative trend, as 13% of boys and 22% of girls reported suicidal thoughts at that time (Dierckens et al., 2019).

Facilitating open discussions about suicidal thoughts is therefore of critical importance. Research has shown that discussing suicidality does not increase suicidal behavior; rather, it can contribute to a reduction in risk (Blades et al., 2018; Dazzi et al., 2014; DeCou \& Schumann, 2018; Polihronis et al., 2022). Breaking the taboo around suicidality and attuning to the emotional experiences of children and adolescents may serve as an initial step toward providing effective support. Such openness can help reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation by fostering a safe environment in which young people feel heard and understood. Moreover, the act of speaking openly about suicidality is associated with increased social support-an important protective factor (Batty et al., 2018; Calati et al., 2019).

In 2023, a project was launched aimed at developing creative materials to support professionals in initiating conversations about suicidality with children and adolescents. This material is being developed through a co-creative process (EC code: ONZ-2024-0211), in collaboration with youth care professionals, method developers, and young individuals with lived experience of suicidal thoughts. These young people provide essential contributions to ensure that the materials are aligned with their needs and expectations for support. This co-creative approach aims not only to produce a theoretically grounded methodology, but also to yield a practically applicable tool that effectively addresses the real-world challenges faced by both professionals and youth. The creative materials are currently under development and are designed to facilitate exploration and discussion of suicidality, ultimately supporting professionals in formulating a risk assessment and developing a Safety Plan. This approach aligns with the recommendations outlined in the guideline ""Detection and Interventions for Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children and Adolescents"" (Dumon et al., 2023).

The next phase of the project focuses on evaluating the creative materials. The evaluation aims to gain insight into their usability and applicability in professional practice. This will be conducted through an evaluation study. Professionals working in Flanders will be recruited via calls on www.zelfmoord1813.be, relevant partner organizations, social media, and newsletters from VLESP and other partners. Additionally, professionals may be invited via email. Those who have used the materials over a three-month period will be asked to retrospectively share their experiences. The study consists of the following steps:

Registration: Eligible professionals complete a short registration form (duration: approximately 5 minutes).

Use of the creative materials: Participants use the materials in their professional context over a period of three months.

Post-assessment: At the end of the three-month period, participants complete a questionnaire regarding their experiences with the materials (duration: approximately 10-15 minutes).

NCT07043205,The Psychophysiology of Walking,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043205,DPVW,COMPLETED,"The literature suggests that natural environments, such as those on the Belgian coast, improve several psychological and physiological health parameters. In these environments, recreational activities often involve walking. However, it is still unknown how the effects of the environment and of walking together influence health. This study investigates the effects of a walk on the Belgian coast versus in the city on various psychological and physiological parameters of mental and physical health, both while walking and at rest after walking. A second set of research questions concerns the determination of the mediating roles of the physical activity performed, the other people in the environment, and environmental factors such as weather and perceived safety. This means that the investigators need to measure how these mediators differ between both environments, and to what extent these mediators have an impact on the subjects. A third set of research questions concerns the moderating roles of the individual characteristics (e.g. age, sex, SES personality, health) on the effects.

100 healthy Belgian adult subjects have to take a walk in both environments according to a within-subject cross-over design, while measurements are taken before, during, and after the walks. Before each walk there is also a walking session on a treadmill for baseline measurements, and rest periods before and during the walk to measure responses after the physical activity with the influence of the environment. The walk on the Belgian coast will take place in Ostend on the dike between the beach and the dunes, and the walk in the city will take place in Ghent center on a similar hard surface.

A lot of physiological measurements will be done to determine the activity of the nervous systems and the HPA axis. More specifically, the heart rate will be derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a general measure of the activation of the body and the high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) as a measure of the change in the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. From a blood volume pulse signal (BVP) the mean arterial Pressure (MAP) will be derived as a general measure for the activation of the body and the blood circulation. From a skin conductance signal (EDA) the skin conductance level (SCL) and skin conductance responses (SCR) will be derived as measures of the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. From a respiration signal, respiration rate and depth will be derived as measures of regulation by the respiratory center in the brain. The average tone will be derived from the electromyogram (EMG) as a measure of musculoskeletal activation. These electrophysiological measurements will be made using sensors on the body and MindMedia's medically validated Nexus-10 MKII device. The activity of the HPA axis of stress will be measured by determining the concentration of the cortisol hormone in saliva.

In addition, many questionnaires will be administered that measure the stress level, mood, psychological tension (arousal), worrying and rumination, mindfulness-related and subjective experiences of the participants.

The investigators will closely monitor the mediating role of physical activity using a smartphone that will measure accelerometry, location and walking speed. The mediating roles of the other persons in the environment, the weather, and other environmental factors (e.g. naturalness) will be retrospectively questioned via post-walk questionnaires. It is not unimportant that many characteristics of the test subjects can respond to the effect sizes. That is why the investigators also ask for a lot of data about demographics, socio-economic status, lifestyle, health, personality, and other factors for the experiment.

The hypothesis is that as a result of the physical activity, all physiological parameters of stress will increase, because physical activity affects the same physiological pathways as those of stress. The walk on the coast would increase the psychological and physiological differently than the walk in the urban environment. According to the literature, these effects should be are mediated by physical activity, other people in the vicinity, weather, and other environmental factors (e.g. perceived naturalness).",NO,Healthy Citizens,BEHAVIORAL: Coastal walk|BEHAVIORAL: Urban walk,"Heart rate in number of beats per minute., Derived from electrocardiogram, Monitored continuously.

NCT07043192,Critical Closing Pressure and PCO₂ Gap in Fluid Resuscitation for Septic Shock,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043192,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This study is based on the following key hypotheses:

PvaCO₂ (Venous-to-Arterial CO₂ Gap) Hypothesis:

Changes in PvaCO₂ (ΔPvaCO₂) following fluid resuscitation correlate with changes in cardiac output (CO) and can serve as a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in septic shock patients.

The relationship between PvaCO₂ and CO is influenced by metabolic factors (VCO₂), hemodynamic status, and the Haldane effect (oxygenation-dependent CO₂ binding to hemoglobin).

Pcrit (Critical Closing Pressure) \& TPP (Tissue Perfusion Pressure) Hypothesis:

Elevated Pcrit and reduced TPP (TPP = MAP - Pcrit) are associated with impaired microcirculatory flow and worse clinical outcomes (e.g., 28-day mortality, organ dysfunction).

Restoring the ""vascular waterfall"" phenomenon (Pcrit \> mean systemic filling pressure) may improve macrocirculation-microcirculation coupling and tissue oxygenation.

2. Study Design Overview 2.1 Study Type Prospective observational cohort with a retrospective validation arm using external databases (e.g., MIMIC-IV).

Single-center study (Peking Union Medical College Hospital ICU). 2.2 Study Population Inclusion Criteria Adults (18-80 years) with septic shock (Sepsis-3 criteria + vasopressor-dependent hypotension + lactate \>2 mmol/L).

Requires invasive hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line, central venous catheter).

Undergoing fluid challenge (clinically indicated). Exclusion Criteria Pregnancy, non-septic shock (e.g., cardiogenic), mechanical circulatory support (ECMO/IABP).

Severe COPD, intracardiac shunts, or conditions interfering with CO₂/VO₂ measurements.

Depending on the treatment, patients experience serious problems. Especially in patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection, lymphedema frequently occurs in the postoperative period. Lymphedema can develop at any time after breast cancer surgery and is difficult to treat once it occurs. Lifelong self-management is essential for breast cancer patients to prevent lymphedema and control or delay its progression. In the literature, it has been reported that patients do not have sufficient information about lymphedema, are not aware that they may have lymphedema in the future and do not receive the necessary support.

NCT07043023,LIDOCRIT : Effect of Continuous Intravenous LIDOcaine on Discomfort in Postoperative CRITical Care Inpatients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043023,LIDOCRIT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Although pain management in intensive care units and intensive care units has improved since the DOLOREA study, research into therapies and techniques to optimise analgesia is still needed. The many adverse effects of morphine are well known, and it has been observed that excessive sedation during the first 48 hours is associated with an increase in mortality and length of stay. Multimodal analgesia protocols, preferably including non-morphine analgesics, could improve the comfort of critical care patients.

Comfort is a central element of critical care and perioperative management, as demonstrated by Patients-Reported Outcomes (PRO), new assessment tools that take into account the patient as a whole. The (Inconfort of REAnimation Patients) IPREA questionnaire, a specific scale for assessing the comfort of critical care patients, is an example of a PRO.

Lidocaine is a voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker, used as a local anaesthetic and antiarrhythmic agent, whose intravenous administration produces analgesic effects, particularly on hyperalgesia. The widely demonstrated clinical benefits in scheduled and major surgery (reduced post-operative pain, reduced doses of anaesthetic agents and opiates, reduced post-operative nausea and vomiting) have led to recommendations for its use. Furthermore, adverse events associated with lidocaine in continuous infusion are minimal.

Based on the early Comfort using Analgesia (eCASH), minimal Sedative and maximal Human care) concepts, the recent PADIS (Pain, Agitation, Delirium, Immobility, Sleep deprivation) recommendations, which determine levels of evidence and research avenues for improving the quality of care, conclude that intravenous lidocaine may be beneficial, but there is a lack of data.

The investigators are therefore proposing a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of lidocaine infused continuously for 48 hours on the perceived comfort of post-operative critical care patients, as assessed by the IPREA score.

IPREA, an 18-item score exploring PADIS, is a direct, relevant, objective and reproducible assessment criterion for evaluating algorithms for improving the quality of care. The data on sources of discomfort reveal the importance of pain, dyspnoea, thirst and sleep deprivation, which are all influenced by the analgesia-sedation protocol. Incorporating lidocaine with anti-hyperalgesic properties into the protocol should reduce discomfort in critical care patients.",NO,Post-surgery Critical Incare,DRUG: Lidocaine (drug)|DRUG: Placebo,"IPREA, Overall score on the Inconforts of Patients in Intensive Care (IPREA) questionnaire.

NCT07043010,WHITE CAP: Intra-operative Parathyroid Tissue Sensor (PTS)-Guided Assessment of Parathyroid Viability and Surgical Decision-Making,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07043010,WHITE CAP-PTS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually cured by removing the single over-active parathyroid adenoma. During surgery, however, surgeons often see a thin rim of normal parathyroid tissue that still ""glows"" under a near-infrared parathyroid tissue sensor (PTS). It is unclear whether keeping this tissue in place helps preserve hormone function or whether it leaves behind cells that could become over-active again.

The WHITE CAP study will compare two common surgical choices:

Preservation strategy - the surgeon removes only the adenoma and leaves the glowing rim of normal tissue untouched.

En-bloc strategy - the surgeon removes the adenoma together with the glowing rim; if too little parathyroid tissue remains, a small fragment is transplanted into the forearm muscle.

About 120 adult patients who have a single parathyroid adenoma will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to one of the two strategies. All operations will use the same FDA-cleared PTS camera that shows the glands in real time without dye or radiation.

The main question is whether preserving the normal rim lowers the rate of temporary low blood-calcium (numbness, tingling) during the first two days after surgery. The study will also check long-term results-blood calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, symptoms, and any return of the disease-over two years.

RET gene alterations occur in only 5-10 % of papillary thyroid cancers, but they can change how surgeons treat the disease. Gene testing is costly and not always performed, so many RET-positive tumours are missed. Researchers have built a computer program (artificial-intelligence or ""AI"" model) that reads routine thyroid ultrasound images and predicts whether the tumour carries a RET alteration and whether the cancer has already spread to lymph-nodes in the side of the neck.

What will happen in this study?

About 800 adults who are scheduled for thyroid-cancer surgery will take part. Each participant will:

* have a standard pre-operative ultrasound exam (no extra scanning time),
* give a routine fine-needle sample for a 14-gene panel test (results in 24 h), and
* allow the AI model to analyse the ultrasound images in the background. Doctors making treatment decisions will not see the AI result. After surgery, the research team will compare the AI predictions with the gene-panel result and the final pathology report.

Main goal: To find out how accurately the AI model detects RET alterations. Secondary goals: To measure the model's ability to predict lymph-node spread, and to compare costs between ultrasound-only prediction and full gene testing.

Benefits and risks: Participants will receive the current standard of care; there is no added risk beyond the usual ultrasound and needle biopsy.

This can make breathing difficult and often leads to an emergency or preventive tracheostomy (""wind-pipe"") surgery.

What: This study will test two simple ways to avoid a tracheostomy:

Pre-operative BiPAP sleep training - patients practice sleeping with a non-invasive BiPAP breathing machine for seven nights before surgery so they become comfortable with the mask and pressures.

Immediate post-extubation BiPAP support - the same BiPAP machine is started as soon as the breathing tube is removed in the operating room or recovery area.

How: Adults (18-80 years) who already have, or are at high risk of getting, BVCP will be randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 2 × 2 design:

• Group 1: training + post-op BiPAP • Group 2: training only • Group 3: post-op BiPAP only • Group 4: standard care (no planned BiPAP).

Main goal: To find out whether either or both BiPAP strategies reduce the need for tracheostomy or re-intubation during the first 7 days after surgery.

What participants do: Eligible patients will undergo routine surgery plus the assigned BiPAP plan. Breathing events, comfort, hospital stay, and voice quality will be recorded up to 6 months.

This requires sinus floor elevation and bone grafting for implant placement. Techniques like the lateral window approach and osteotome-mediated sinus floor elevation aim to achieve the necessary vertical bone height for implants. Autogenous bone grafts have been the gold standard but have limitations like donor site morbidity and graft volume loss, leading to the exploration of alternatives. Membranes, such as resorbable collagen or titanium-reinforced materials, are commonly used in these procedures but have limitations related to customization, cost, and failure rates.Recent studies have suggested that placing implants directly into the sinus without grafting material can stimulate bone formation, leveraging blood clots to activate bone-forming cells.

Childhood ALL survivors experience markedly impaired physical capacity - reducing their opportunity to engage in everyday activities including leisure activities, sports, and school - affecting their quality of life. Furthermore, Childhood ALL survivors have markedly increased risk of chronic medical conditions including cardiometabolic diseases - that can be prevented through an active lifestyle. Thus, it is imperative to develop novel interventions that can mitigate these treatment-related late-effects. In this RCT, including 82 childhood ALL survivors (10-21 years-old), we will investigate a 26-week online exercise intervention combined with access to a lifestyle physical activity webpage, and health consultations on cardiorespiratory fitness (primary outcome) markers of metabolic syndrome, and physical activity habits.

While other pilot studies have investigated the effects of exercise for childhood ALL survivors, this study is the first RCT internationally to investigate the effects of online exercise combined with education through an app and health counselling for childhood ALL survivor. Using this approach, we are geographically able to reach every survivor in our targeted population, thereby, minimizing logistic challenges like travel distances.

This study has the potential to radically change the way physical rehabilitation is approached in childhood ALL survivors - Potentially changing the workflow of health professionals from referring only survivors with specific deficits to local physiotherapy to referring all survivors to an exercise program tailored to their needs. By improving the children's general physical capacity, we can give the children the required tools to re-enter everyday life activities, including school physical education, leisure activities, and sports earlier after treatment has ended - ultimately minimizing the social complications of treatment.

NCT07042906,Comparison of the Factors Affecting PSI and BIS Values in Monitoring Anesthetic Depth During Open-Heart Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042906,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Measurement of anesthetic depth has long been a subject of investigation, aiming to titrate anesthetic agents appropriately and to prevent intraoperative awareness and consciousness. Many patients undergoing surgery experience fear and anxiety regarding the possibility of remaining conscious, perceiving pain, and being unable to move during anesthesia. Intraoperative awareness-defined as consciousness during anesthesia with explicit recall afterward-is a distressing condition that can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.

However, aiming for excessively deep anesthesia to avoid the possibility of awareness during surgery is not recommended, as it may result in hemodynamic instability due to the effects of anesthetic agents and may impair postoperative cognitive functions, particularly in the elderly population.

Common methods used in monitoring anesthetic depth include observing sweating, lacrimation, pupillary dilation, heart rate variability, and blood pressure. However, some of these are subjective and may not always be reliable indicators.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors such as the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Patient State Index (PSI) offer more reliable and objective means of monitoring anesthetic depth. These monitors provide numerical values between 0 (indicating unconsciousness) and 100 (indicating full alertness) based on proprietary algorithms, offering valuable insight into the patient's anesthetic state.

""Our aim is to examine BIS and PSI values and to investigate the factors that influence these parameters.""",NO,BIS-EEG|PSI|Open Heart Surgery|Anesthesia Depth Monitoring,"DEVICE: anesthesia depth monitorizing, awareness","The primary objective of this study is to measure the correlation between BIS and PSI values, which are parameters used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during open-heart surgery., BIS (Bispectral Index) is a monitoring method that uses EEG (electroencephalogram) data to measure the depth of anesthesia. It has been used for a long time to assess anesthetic depth. PSI (Patient State Index) is a monitoring method that has become more popular in recent years for measuring the depth of anesthesia. The recommended reference ranges for anesthetic depth are 40-60 for BIS and 25-50 for PSI. The primary objective of this study is to measure the correlation between PSI and BIS values during open-heart surgery., Data will be collected over a 12-month period and subjected to statistical analysis.","The secondary objective of this study is to measure the effect of hypothermia, which develops after patients are connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine during open-heart surgery, on BIS and PSI values that indicate the depth of anesthesia, BIS is a monitoring method that uses EEG (electroencephalogram) data to measure the depth of anesthesia.

Brief Summary:

This prospective, experimental, and comparative study evaluated the impact of two different subciliary wound closure techniques in patients undergoing surgical repair of orbital floor fractures. The study was conducted at a tertiary care center in Mexico from July to October 2024 and included 100 adult patients with isolated orbital floor fractures, excluding LeFort-type fractures.

Participants were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received skin-only subciliary sutures, while Group 2 underwent closure using both cutaneous and periosteal sutures. The objective was to determine whether the addition of periosteal sutures influenced the rate of common postoperative complications, including eyelid retraction, ectropion, and the need for surgical reintervention.

Postoperative evaluations were conducted on days 8, 15, and 30. Outcomes measured included incidence of eyelid retraction, ectropion, reoperation rate, and any association with comorbidities such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, or substance use.

The study found a statistically higher incidence of eyelid retraction in the group with combined periosteal and cutaneous closure at postoperative day 8 (16% vs. 2%, p=0.014) and day 15 (20% vs. 6%, p=0.037). However, no significant differences were noted in rates of ectropion or reintervention. Smoking, the most common comorbidity in the cohort, was not associated with a higher rate of complications.

This study suggests that skin-only closure may be preferable in subciliary orbital approaches, as it is associated with fewer cases of eyelid retraction without increasing the risk of other complications.",NO,Orbital Floor Fractures|Surgical Wound Closure Techniques|Subciliary Surgical Approach|Postoperative Complications in Maxillofacial Surgery,PROCEDURE: Cutaneous Suture|PROCEDURE: Periosteal Suture,"Incidence of Lower Eyelid Retraction, The presence of clinically observable lower eyelid retraction following subciliary surgical closure will be evaluated through physical examination.

NPC is a radiosensitive cancer so radiotherapy is the basic therapy for NPC. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is the standard therapy for locally advanced NPC. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with head and neck cancer including NPC. Several studies have shown better outcomes and fewer complications of therapy in patients with higher vitamin D levels. Inflammation plays an important role in tumor development and progression. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancerous and precancerous lesions shows that there is a potential for major changes in IL-6 levels.

By supplementing vitamin D in NPC patients with vitamin D deficiency before undergoing chemoradiation, it will increase the therapeutic response and reduce IL-6 levels (proinflammatory cytokines).

GFR estimation equations all share the disadvantage of imperfect accuracy due to non-GFR-related determinants of creatinine and cystatin C. When knowing the exact GFR value is necessary for clinical decision-making, measurement by clearance of an exogenous tracer is required. Various tracers are available, some of which are radioactive tracers (99mTc-DTPA and 51Cr-EDTA), while others are iodinated contrast agents (iohexol, iothalamate). GFR measurement procedures are time-consuming and require significant human resources (4 to 5 hours, or even 24 hours for plasma clearances at very low GFR values).Urinary clearance methods may be inaccurate in cases of inadequate voiding. Plasma clearance results may be inaccurate in cases of increased (overestimation) or decreased (underestimation) extracellular volume, low GFR (unless late sampling is performed), or glomerular hyperfiltration. Measuring tracers requires either warm labs for measuring radioactive markers or labs with HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) chains for iohexol, which are part of an external quality assurance program. The complexity and/or length of GFR measurement procedures, their cost, and laboratory constraints explain why measured GFR is underused in routine clinical practice. There is a critical need to develop GFR measurement methods that are simpler to implement, reliable across the entire GFR spectrum, and widely available. We have demonstrated that it is possible to measure GFR using 4-phase CT urography performed as part of the care of living kidney donor candidates (healthy individuals with normal GFR).

NCT07042659,Effectiveness of Blue Light for Hard-to-heal Wounds,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042659,,COMPLETED,"Hard-to-heal wounds-those that fail to heal despite appropriate treatment-are a growing clinical challenge, often leading to significant discomfort, reduced quality of life, and high healthcare costs. These wounds are common among older adults and individuals with chronic conditions such as venous disease, diabetes, and lymphatic disorders. Photobiomodulation, a non-invasive therapy that uses specific wavelengths of light to stimulate biological processes, has shown promise in promoting wound healing. However, its effectiveness for long-standing, treatment-resistant wounds is not yet well established.

This pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of an accelerated photobiomodulation protocol using blue light in patients with hard-to-heal wounds. The study takes place in nurse-led outpatient wound care clinics within the local health authority of Turin (ASL Città di Torino, Italy), which serves a diverse urban population.

Eligible patients are adults with venous, diabetic, lymphatic, or mixed etiology wounds that have remained unhealed for at least two years. Participants receive blue light photobiomodulation treatment twice weekly for four weeks, in addition to standard wound care. Each session includes direct application of blue light to the wound area, following appropriate wound bed preparation and dressing changes.

The primary outcome is the reduction in wound size, measured at baseline, at the end of treatment (week 4), and at a follow-up visit (week 12). Secondary outcomes include changes in pain levels, wound exudate characteristics, and the condition of surrounding skin. Adverse events are monitored throughout the study.

The disrupted synchronization of gamma oscillations in the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit is a potential key mechanism. Our study has demonstrated that white matter lesions lead to demyelination of the connection tracts between the prefrontal lobe and hippocampus, which is closely related to memory dysfunction. However, further studies are required to explore if these microstructural changes in white matter tracts influence memory function by affecting gamma oscillations. Thus, this project will use the previously established episodic memory task and event-related potential to determine the changes in gamma oscillations in the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit and the effects on memory encoding and retrieval. Combining multimodal imaging, we will explore the mediating role of white matter microstructure damage, and establish a machine learning prediction model for memory impairment. In addition, transcranial alternation current stimulation (tACS) will be used to investigate the mechanisms of memory improvement by regulating the prefrontal-hippocampal gamma oscillations.

VMS frequency is defined as the number of moderate or severe hot flashes or night sweats reported per day.

Moderate VMS: sensation of heat with sweating, without disruption of activity. Severe VMS: sensation of heat with sweating that causes cessation of activity or awakening at night.

The outcome is calculated as the average number of moderate/severe VMS episodes per day, averaged over the 8-week treatment period.

Due to protocol-defined eligibility criteria, all participants will report at least 40 moderate/severe VMS episodes per week at baseline. During treatment, the minimum possible observed value is 0 episodes/day. There is no fixed upper limit; values of 20-30 episodes/day may occur.

Fecal microbiome transplantation consists of fecal microbiota from healthy donors with healthy gut microbiota that allows re-population of the patient's microbiome with diverse protective microorganisms. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Part of the treatment for CAR T therapy involves high doses of chemotherapy. This, along with prior exposure to high strength antibiotics, can damage patient's intestinal microbiota.

It will also explore how the program affects their food choices, knowledge, intentions, practices, and self-reported behaviors towards sustainable food choices, as well as energy and nutrient intake.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the Ta'am Mustadam program increase intake of fruits, vegetables, and plant-based foods?
* Does it reduce red and processed meat consumption?
* Does it change participants' food choice?

The minor questions it aims to answer are:

* Does it improve participants' knowledge, intentions, practices toward sustainable eating?
* Does it change participant's energy and nutrient intake?

Participants will:

* Take part in a 6-week program, followed by a 4-week follow-up
* Receive engaging educational messages
* Watch interactive video recipes
* Participate in hands-on activities
* Complete questionnaires before, right after, and one month after the program

NCT07042373,Effects of Tobacco Abuse Liability-dependent Taxes in the ETM,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042373,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In a within-subject design, cigarette smokers, stratified by age, will purchase tobacco products under three tax rate conditions based on abuse liability, that is taxes based on: (1) product category score (i.e. score ranging from 0-1 based on abuse liability effect sizes); (2) product category rank (i.e. position of a product relative to all others; e.g. 1st, 5th); and (3) product tiers (i.e. low-, medium-, high abuse liability), as well as a control. In the ETM, the effects of these interventions will be examined on cigarette demand and other products substitution.

The investigators will use a repeated-measures (within subject) analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test if there are differences between conditions (i.e., tax proposals) independently for each product. The models will include study design parameters for order effects to account for counterbalancing the tax conditions in the ETM. Each tax condition will be compared to the control. All distributional assumptions will be checked prior to analyses and the appropriate transformations will be employed, if needed. For each significant result from the omnibus test, the investigators will perform planned contrasts to test the proposed hypotheses previously described. Note that the omnibus test can result in a significant finding while the contrasts of interest may be non-significant. In this case, the investigators will only report the results from the planned contrasts.

NCT07042360,Application of Comprehensive Non-invasive Assessment To Phenotype Tricuspid Regurgitation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042360,TRIREF,RECRUITING,"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is an increasingly recognized valvular heart disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. With the availability of various novel transcatheter tricuspid interventions, it is no longer considered a ""forgotten valve."" Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a prevalent condition also characterized by high morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of moderate to severe TR in the general population is 3% to 6%; however, in patients with heart failure (with reduced or preserved ejection fraction \[EF\]), the prevalence is 10% to 29%, rising to up to 39% in patients with HFpEF and atrial fibrillation (AF). The EuroTR registry, an international registry including patients who underwent percutaneous treatment for severe TR, reported that 72% of patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50%. In a subgroup of patients with right heart catheterization data, 68% had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≥15 mm Hg, indicating that many of these patients may have HFpEF. Patients with significant TR have also been shown to experience irreversible liver derangement and cirrhosis. Non-invasive evaluation of liver stiffness (LS), measured by transient elastography, has recently received increased attention in patients with heart failure and has been shown to closely correlate with right-sided filling pressures. LS has been used to predict adverse outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve (TA) surgery with concomitant left-sided valve surgery.

On the other hand, the Remote Dielectric Sensing System (ReDS; Sensible Medical Innovations, Israel) is a device that measures lung fluid non-invasively and provides an objective and reproducible index of volume status. It is an FDAapproved device for heart failure patients. ReDS measurements are presented as the percentage of fluid relative to lung volume, with normal values ranging between 20% to 35%. Studies have demonstrated excellent correlations between the ReDS index and computed tomography (CT)-measured lung water and invasively determined hemodynamics. Additionally, it has been shown to predict heart failure rehospitalization in patients with acute heart failure.

Given the emergence of novel transcatheter tricuspid interventions and the established link between TR, HFpEF, and markers such as liver stiffness and lung fluid index (measured by ReDS), this study will examine the intricate interplay between these conditions and their shared pathophysiology. By analyzing left and right heart function, risk factors, and treatment outcomes, the research aims to phenotype TR using non-invasive assessment tools to predict clinical outcomes and improve treatment strategies for patients with different types of TR. Our findings will contribute to developing more effective and personalized treatment plans for patients with TR.",NO,Tricuspid Regurgitation,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ReDs Pro|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fibroscan,"Heart failure hospitalisation rate, Heart failure hospitalization rate of subjects at 1 year, 1 year|Tricuspid valve intervention rate, Tricuspid valve intervention rate of subjects at 1 year, 1 year|Cardiovascular mortality rate, Cardiovascular mortality rate of subjects at 1 year, 1 year","Heart failure hospitalisation rate, Heart failure hospitalization rate of subjects at 6-month, 6-month|Tricuspid valve intervention rate, 1-year tricuspid valve intervention of subjects at 12-month, 12-month|NYHA Classification, Assess 6-month symptom burden via NYHA classification, 6-month|NYHA Classification, Assess 1 year symptom burden via NYHA classification, 12-month|Quality of Life measures, Assess Quality of Life measures of subject at 6-month via Kansas City Cardiomyophthy Questionnaire-12.

NCT07042256,Feasibility of MR-Informed Adaptive Marker-less SBRT in Patients With Bilateral Hip Prostheses Undergoing SBRT for Localized Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042256,HIP-PRO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Hip replacements and prostate cancer are independently and both together increasing prevalent in the aging population. In the United States, the prevalence of hip prostheses among men was 1.1 million in 20101, with approximately 500,000 hip prostheses performed annually. Bilateral total hip replacement is recommended for patients with osteoarthritis affecting both hip joints. Approximately 10-25% of total hip replacement patients undergo bilateral procedures. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been widely adopted as an effective treatment for localized prostate cancer, offering high precision and reduced treatment time due to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy without increasing toxicity or comprising oncological outcomes. Therefore, the use of SBRT for treatment of localized prostate cancer has significantly increased. A cohort study using data from 302 035 patients in the National Cancer Database showed that use of SBRT for prostate cancer increased from 0.2% in 2004 to 12.4% in 2020 in the United States.

However, both CT and MR-guided SBRT present unique challenges for patients with prostate cancer and bilateral hip prostheses. Metallic implants, such as hip prostheses, produce artifacts and magnetic susceptibility issues that can obscure MR imaging near the prosthetic sites, potentially complicating target contouring and planning. Given the close proximity of the prostate gland to the pelvis, which houses the hip joints, patients with bilateral hip prostheses may have significant imaging artifacts that could impair MR-guided radiotherapy quality. CT-based SBRT is less affected by metallic artifacts, but it lacks the soft-tissue resolution needed for precise prostate and OAR delineation, a gap MR imaging is uniquely positioned to fill.

Low-field MRI systems are less prone to susceptibility artifacts, including those originating from metallic implants. As a result, signal loss and distortion are expected to occur only in the immediate vicinity of the implant, making these systems particularly advantageous for imaging patients with hip implants. A prospective study quantitatively and qualitatively compared the magnitude of metal total hip arthroplasty-induced imaging artifacts in vivo between 1.5T (i.e. high-field) and 0.55T (low-field) MRI in 15 patients. Qualitative artifact magnitude was on average rated as moderate to small on 0.55T and as large to moderate on 1.5T by 2 fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists. In addition, metal artifacts' areas and diameters were smaller on 0.55T when compared with 1.5T MRI for all sequences (each p\>0.016).

Given the limitations of current imaging systems, the investigators propose a more flexible solution: a two-room system comprising a low-field MRI scanner for optimal image quality and a C-arm linear accelerator for rapid treatment delivery. Patient transfer between the MR device and the linear accelerator will be performed with a shuttle system which uses an air-bearing patient platform for both procedures. This setup would allow for high-quality imaging with reduced artifacts while ensuring efficient treatment times, addressing the current gap in SBRT for patients with bilateral hip prostheses. This shuttle system is MR-compatible and uses an air-bearing technology that allows the patient to be effortlessly moved by a transfer sled from MR scanner couch to linac without any movement on their part as it utilises the same patient platform with treatment using supports, immobilization devices and stereotactic tools for both procedures.

NCT07042230,Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation And Passive Vertebral Mobilization For Neck Disability In Patients With Mechanical Neck Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07042230,,COMPLETED,"Mechanical neck pain is a common musculoskeletal condition that affects many people, especially those with poor posture or repetitive neck movements. It can cause discomfort, reduce the ability to move the neck, and affect daily functioning. This study aimed to compare the effects of two physiotherapy treatments-Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) and Passive Vertebral Mobilization (PVM)-on neck pain, disability, and movement.

This randomized controlled trial was conducted at the University of Lahore Teaching Hospital over nine months. A total of 62 participants, aged 18 to 35 years, who had mechanical neck pain for at least four weeks, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A received PNF, while Group B received PVM. Both treatments were delivered by physiotherapists three times per week for four weeks.

PNF is an active therapy that involves specific movement patterns to improve muscle coordination and flexibility. PVM is a passive manual therapy technique where the therapist gently moves the neck vertebrae to improve joint mobility and reduce pain.

Outcomes were measured using the Neck Disability Index (NDI), the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and measurements of neck movement (Active Cervical Range of Motion, or ACROM) at the start of the study, at two weeks, and at the end of the four-week treatment. The study was single-blinded-meaning the person assessing the outcomes did not know which treatment the patient received.

The results showed that both treatments significantly improved pain, movement, and function. However, the group that received PNF showed slightly greater reduction in pain scores by the end of the treatment. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of disability or movement range.

This study concluded that both PNF and PVM are beneficial treatments for mechanical neck pain. PNF may offer slightly faster pain relief, while both interventions are effective at improving mobility and reducing neck-related disability. These findings can help guide physiotherapists and patients in choosing suitable treatment options for neck pain.",NO,Neck Pain|Neck Pain Musculoskeletal|Mechanical Neck Pain|Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation|Mobilization,OTHER: Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF)|OTHER: Passive Vertebral Mobilization (PVM),"Neck Disability, The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a validated, self-reported questionnaire that assesses disability related to neck pain.

With the increase in the use of electronic products and the decrease in the time for outdoor exercise, the incidence of myopia is increasing year by year. Smith et al. firstly found that peripheral retinal defocus affects the course of myopia development in rhesus monkeys. Subsequent studies have shown that peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus can lead to the growth of the axial length (AL), leading to the development of myopia, while peripheral retinal myopic defocus can effectively slow down the growth of the AL, thus delaying the progression of myopia. Defocus signals can simultaneously change the thickness of the choroid, the vascular tissue behind the retina, and the pigment epithelium, and change the thickness and hardness of the sclera, inhibiting or promoting the growth of the axial length. Therefore, many methods have been designed to intervene in the development of myopia, including orthokeratology and peripheral defocusing glasses. The maintenance process of orthokeratology lens is complex and there is a risk of infection. Peripheral defocus glasses need to be worn for a long time, and the visual quality is unstable. It is still necessary to explore safer, more effective and more practical methods for myopia control. In addition, there may be some correlation between the development of myopia and the decrease of choroidal blood flow. Defocus signal may promote the increase of choroidal blood flow, which may be a way to prevent and control myopia.

Therefore, the investigators integrated the digital defocus paradigm into VR devices and developed a digital defocus vision training (DDVT) system.

These are essential for brain development and immune system function, and preterm infants receiving donor milk do not receive sufficient levels of these nutrients. There is therefore an urgent need to develop nutritional guidelines and resources for milk donors.

   This will be a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with two groups, an experimental or intervention group and a control group.
2. Population, criteria, sample, calculation.

   The study population will be low-risk pregnant women.

   Inclusion criteria:
   * Pregnant women at low obstetric risk and with no musculoskeletal or health problems affecting their physical condition, ability to exercise or participate in the exergame activities.
   * Read the information sheet and sign the informed consent form to agree to take part in the study.
   * \>18 years of age
   * Spanish comprehension and communication skills
   * Able to perform physical activity related to the use of the device for at least 30 minutes, 2-3 times a week, for at least 8 weeks

   Exclusion criteria:
   * Failure to meet any of the inclusion criteria
   * Giving birth during the procedure and at least 8 weeks of device use have not elapsed.

   Assignment: All women receiving maternal education from all participating health centers will be randomized to ensure that there is no sample contamination and their relevance to the intervention or control group will be established according to randomization.

   Sample size calculation: It was estimated that the number of participants should be at least 15% for this pilot study of what would be a future intervention project. Using self-perceived physical fitness as the dependent variable, and in validation studies having had samples of around 160 women (Romero-Gallardo et al., 2020), at least 24 women will be needed in the single intervention group for this pilot study. Similarly, at least 24 women in the control group are needed for comparison. It is estimated that 20% of women may drop out of the intervention before the minimum 8 weeks, thus establishing a sample size of at least 30 women to recruit. Using similar studies (Tuan et al., 2024) as a reference, we will try to reach the ideal sample size of 42 healthy pregnant women who complete the intervention and at least 42 for the control group who receive routine pregnancy follow-up EpS and antenatal classes.
3. Description of the intervention.

   * Intervention Group: The program consists of using the device, a minimum of 30 minutes per session two to three times per week and not exceeding ≥3 hours, for at least 8 weeks up to a maximum of 3 months or until the onset of discomfort disabling physical activity, with the minimum time for intervention being at least 8 weeks. Exercise based on exergames will be performed including at least 10 minutes of warm-up and 10 minutes of cool-down, and under the supervision of a licensed health professional.

The training program will focus on strength and functional movements. It requires a Nintendo Switch console, a Ring-Con (a Pilates ring that the user holds or ring holder), wireless Joy-Con controllers (the right Joy-Con, connected to the Ring-Con; and the left Joy-Con, attached to the strap around the player's thigh) and a screen. In adventure mode, women will move through the game by performing physical activities such as jogging or doing squats. To minimize risk, knee-assist mode will be used, which makes the game more accessible. Activating knee assist mode provides support when women perform exercises that require walking, kneeling or squatting, making these activities easier for pregnant women, increasing the fitness benefits of the game. In battle mode women will perform aerobic activities, strength training and yoga exercises that involve the whole body to advance in the game. Women will receive in-game coin rewards, character customization and level progression based on exercise volume, which encourages improvement of their skills. As an example, with the assisted knee mode, women will have to squeeze and stretch the titular ring working muscles such as the trapezius, triceps, pectoralis major and minor and abdominal muscles. In addition, to go about defeating the monsters they will have to do shoulder abduction and adduction exercises, internal and external rotation of the shoulders and flexion of the elbow as shown in the images of the orientation trailer, provided to women and available in this memory.

@Control Group: Low-risk pregnant women who have normal pregnancy follow-up with Health Education received in childbirth preparation classes and maternal education received in routine pregnancy care by primary and specialized care midwives.

Masking: Unique (Results Evaluator).

Does FCV reduce the mechanical power (a key determinant of ventilator-induced lung injury) compared to conventional pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) during ventilation of patients with burn injury?

Researchers will compare FCV with PCV for up to 70 hours of ventilation to see if the mechanical power is reduced during ventilation of participants being in need of ventilation after severe burn injury.

Ventilation of participants will be controlled by either FCV or PCV. Group-specific ventilation will have the following characteristics:

* FCV: Control of airway flows during inspiration and expiration, use of individualized lower and upper airway pressures and no fixed values for the volumes being inspired and expired (tidal volumes)
* PCV: No control of airway flows during expiration, use of individualized lower airway pressures and upper airway pressures for a fixed tidal volume during each breath (6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight)

NCT07041814,A Study Comparing Different Treatment Approaches for the Initiation of Puberty in Girls With Turner Syndrome Using a TRIFECTA-DARED Approach for Rare Diseases,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041814,TRIFECTA-DARED,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Turner syndrome is a condition in which a girl's body does not make enough estrogen on its own, so doctors give estrogen medicine to help start breast and uterine (womb) development. Hence, the goal of this clinical trial is to learn whether two different ways of giving estrogen help girls and young women with Turner syndrome go through puberty normally, and to compare how well each method works and how safe they are.

The main questions the trial aims to answer are:

1. Does taking an oral estrogen tablet (Progynova) or applying an estrogen gel (Oestrogel) lead to better breast development?
2. Does one method lead to a larger uterine size as seen on ultrasound?
3. Do participants start menstrual-like (withdrawal) bleeding, and does one method cause it sooner?
4. What side effects (for example, headaches, nausea, changes in blood tests) happen with each method?

Who can take part?

* Girls and young women aged 11-30 years with a confirmed diagnosis of Turner syndrome and no previous estrogen treatment.
* They have not yet begun puberty (no breast growth, and a small uterus on ultrasound).
* They agree to follow the study schedule and keep a diary of any bleeding or side effects

What will happen to the participants during the clinical trial?

* Get assigned at random to one of two groups (1:1 ratio):

  1. Gel group: Apply Oestrogel (17β-estradiol) to the skin, starting twice a week, then daily with increasing doses over 18 months.
  2. Tablet group: Swallow Progynova (estradiol valerate) tablets, starting twice a week, then daily with increasing doses over 18 months.
* Visit the clinic at 6, 12, and 18 months for:

  1. A physical exam (including breast staging).
  2. An ultrasound to measure uterine length and thickness.
  3. A blood test for safety checks (triglycerides and other markers).
  4. Keep a diary noting any spotting or bleeding (called withdrawal bleeding) and any side effects.

Why does this matter?

Girls and young women with Turner syndrome often need estrogen to begin puberty safely. This trial will show which method-gel or tablets-best mimics natural puberty (breast and uterine growth), how quickly menstrual-like bleeding begins, and which has fewer unwanted effects.

NCT07041684,Microbiota and Lipedema Evaluation in Obese Patient Treated With Very Low Energy Ketogenic Vegan Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041684,MLVLEKVT,COMPLETED,"Lipedema is a progressive, hereditary, multifactorial disease that occurs primarily in women, characterized by an abnormal and painful accumulation of subcutaneous fatty tissue. The etiology of lipedema is not entirely clear, but genetic, hormonal, vascular, and lymphatic factors have been implicated. Recent research suggests a potential role of the gut microbiota in the etiopathogenesis and progression of the disease, as alterations in gut microbial composition (dysbiosis) could contribute to chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction that exacerbate the fat deposition typical of lipedema.

The condition is often associated with obesity, contributing to a state of chronic inflammation that exacerbates its progression. Among management strategies, Very Low Energy Ketogenic Therapy (VLEKT) has been proposed for its potential in improving inflammation and metabolism. VLEKT, an extremely low-calorie dietary regimen that induces ketosis through carbohydrate reduction, has been studied primarily for weight management, but the adoption of a plant-protein variant could offer additional benefits due to their anti-inflammatory properties resulting primarily from positive modulation of the gut microbiota.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a plant protein-based ketogenic diet on the composition of the gut microbiota of obese patients with lipedema and to observe how it affected the symptoms of the condition. This experimental study analyzed anthropometric, metabolic, inflammatory parameters and the gut microbiota, as well as quality of life. The results obtained made it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of this dietary approach in the context of lipedema management, emphasizing the role of the gut microbiota and the anti-inflammatory properties of plant proteins. However, the single-center nature and limited number of participants represent limitations for generalizing the results.

Methods The present work is a prospective experimental study, in which a participant group consisting of 20 female individuals with lipedema were observed and offered plant protein-based VLEKT. Patients chosen to participate in the study were identified according to the following eligibility criteria: female subjects aged \>18 years with a diagnosis of clinical stage II-III lipedema and with prior dietary treatment.

The presence of any of the following conditions prevented their enrollment in the study: subjects without an indication for treatment or unable to undergo VLEKT treatment; pregnancy and lactation; treatment with drugs interfering with proper microbiota analysis; and male subjects.

Each subject participating in the study underwent an initial outpatient specialist examination, and through the medical history, the following data were collected: age, sex, general and pathological health condition, and hematochemical parameters paying attention especially to CRP, blood glucose, insulin, total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Anthropometric parameters were then taken, including: weight; height; waist circumference; hip circumference; right and left thigh circumference; right and left arm circumference; right and left calf circumference; and right and left ankle circumference.

NCT07041502,Aut-CARE Intervention to Improve Cognitive and Emotional Functioning in Young Adults on the Autism Spectrum,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041502,Aut-CARE,RECRUITING,"Currently, many autistic youths struggle to adapt to academic programs or the workforce, often turning to third-sector organizations such as specialized associations and foundations. This may be due to factors such as emotional dysregulation and executive dysfunction, which interfere with their psychosocial adaptation abilities, leading to anxiety and depression. These challenges have a neurobiological basis tied to the unique complexities of the autistic brain, which experiences emotional and cognitive overload and lacks attentional filters. To address this issue, the emotional and executive functioning of autistic youths at the Friends Foundation will be assessed through objective and subjective assessments.

This data collection will serve as a foundation for conceptualizing and co-creating a more realistic affective-cognitive remediation program, integrating user perspectives (conceptualization of interventions for systematic implementation). The program aims to improve the socio-occupational and emotional adaptation difficulties that often contribute to mental health challenges within this underserved population. It is important to highlight that many existing programs focus on cognitive training and social skills, neglecting strategies for adaptation and emotional regulation.

NCT07041463,Psychoeducation Program for Family Caregivers Coordinated by an APRN,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041463,APIPEP,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The aim of this study is to assess the impact of implementing a specific family program coordinated by APRNs, covering the 5 levels of the family care pyramid through a consultation, an individual psychoeducation program and a group psychoeducation program, on improving caregiver burden and thus contributing to the recovery of users suffering from FEP.

Detailed Description: Psychotic disorders are among the most disabling chronic pathologies in psychiatry. These disorders modify the individual's perceptions, thoughts, moods, behaviours and day-to-day functioning (Implementing interventions as early as possible in the first psychotic episode (FEP) would be likely to decrease the severity and consequences of the illness and improve prospects for recovery. Evidence supports the establishment of multidisciplinary teams to detect early and treat early those experiencing FEP and those at increased risk of psychosis. Recommended interventions include cognitive-behavioral therapies, family interventions, employment and educational support, and above all, at the heart of the system, case management. These specialized teams need to be multidisciplinary, bringing together psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers in addition to case managers. More recently in France, Advanced practice nurse (APRN) have joined these teams. But getting young people to accept both disorders and care is a difficult necessity, and remains a major challenge. Poor compliance with treatment is said to be one of the primary causes of relapse after FEP. Factors that increase the risk of relapse include initially more severe symptoms, persistent substance abuse, poor adherence to treatment and inadequate support from family and friends. Nowadays, support from a close caregiver for a person living with a psychic disorder is recognized as a very favorable factor for long-term prognosis. But the occurrence of a FEP often has the effect of a tidal wave for loved ones, who present high levels of psychological distress and feelings of burden. Unfortunately, it is still difficult for families to gain access to family caregiver support services, which are still insufficiently available and often unknown to them. A number of barriers stand in the way of systematically proposing family interventions, such as health professionals' lack of awareness of the effectiveness of interventions aimed at family carers, their difficulty in establishing a double therapeutic alliance with the young person and his or her family, or the misperception that family interventions are in contradiction with professional secrecy.

The pyramid of family care in early intervention presents the family support that should be available to families of young people with FEP. The levels of intervention are designed to meet the support needs of family caregivers and can be used flexibly depending on specific needs or the phase of the psychotic episode. Also, APRNs could contribute to the success of these caregiver support programs thanks to their skills in prevention, assessment and coordination of complex pathways. This study therefore aims to determine the extent to which a specific program coordinated by APRNs can influence the burden of a family caregiver of a young person suffering from FEP.",NO,First Episode Psychosis (FEP)|Caregiver Burden|Nurse Practitioners|IMPACT OF A NEW PSYCHOEDUCATION PROGRAM COORDINATED BY AN ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE ON THE BURDEN OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH A FIRST PSYCHOTIC EPISODE,OTHER: Psychoeducation program coordinated by an APRN|OTHER: Usual Care,"Caregiver's burden, The ZARIT scale is a validated, self-reported questionnaire that assesses the emotional, physical and financial burden of caring for a sick person.

However, in societies where sexual health education is inadequate, factors such as social norms and gender inequality hinder individuals from properly understanding sexual health and developing healthy sexual behaviors. The gender roles established by society and the stereotypes associated with these roles shape individuals' sexual identities and experiences, often based on narrow and rigid views of masculinity and femininity. In societies where gender roles are strictly defined, such norms can place serious limitations on individuals' sexual rights, freedoms, and ability to form healthy relationships.

In this context, sexual health education plays a vital role in raising awareness about societal norms and helping transform these norms. Gender inequality is another major barrier that complicates the accurate understanding of sexual health. In many communities, especially for women, sexual rights are limited due to cultural values, traditional beliefs, and social pressures. This restricts their access to sexual health services and their ability to protect themselves.

NCT07041268,Immunotherapy of the Recent-onset Type 1 Diabetes in Adolescents With Repeated Courses of Rituximab,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041268,,RECRUITING,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by destruction of pancreatic islet beta-cells that produce insulin - the hormone required for glucose uptake by body tissues and organs. Since loss of beta-cells leads to insulin deficiency, blood glucose increases and the symptoms of T1D (thirst, hunger, excessive urination) appear. Inability of patient's tissues and organs to utilize glucose results in rapid weight loss and life-threatening acute T1D complications - ketosis and coma. To ensure glucose consumption by tissues and organs and to prevent acute complications, all patients with T1D need lifelong therapy with insulin. Insulin therapy is also necessary to prevent long-term T1D complications (eye, renal, nerve, and heart problems). By the time T1D is diagnosed, 80-90% of beta-cells have already been destroyed. However, 10-20% viable insulin-producing beta-cells remain in the pancreas over several months and even years after T1D diagnosis. The higher the percentage of the remaining beta-cells, the smaller the risk of long-term complications.

Destruction of beta-cells in T1D has an autoimmune origin. It means that the patient's immune system, which is normally targeted at microbes, viruses, and other non-self substances, mistakenly destroys the beta-cells. The key role in this autoimmune reaction is played by specific cells of the immune system: T- and B-lymphocytes. T-lymphocytes directly damage the beta-cells, while B-lymphocytes support T-lymphocytes activity via antigen presentation mechanisms.

Rituximab is a drug that specifically eliminates B-lymphocytes from the blood based on the CD20 surface molecule expressed on their surface, as a target. Notably, a subset of currently active T cells, including those potentially associated with pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, also express CD20 marker on their surface. This makes them a potentially another critically important target of rituximab. In 2009 - 2014, a multicenter study in the U. S. and Canada showed that a single three-week course of rituximab infusions slightly but significantly had improved survival of residual beta-cells and their insulin-producing capacity in patients with recent-onset T1D. However, this beneficial action of rituximab lasted for only one year.

We hypothesized that the repeated courses of rituximab performed over a period of 5 months could produce more profound and durable elimination of pathogenic B- and T- cells, and as a consequence prolonged survival of residual beta-cells and insulin secretion without serious adverse events. Testing this hypothesis is the goal of our study",NO,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1",BIOLOGICAL: rituximab,"Change in the Mean C-peptide Area Under Curve (AUC) Standardized by Duration of the Mixed Meal Tolerance Test, Calculation of the AUC is based on serum C-peptide measurements performed at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of the MMTT.

According to the literature, 15.6-27% of colon lesions 6-9 mm in size and 4.4-10% of those ≤5 mm are high-risk lesions, i.e. they contain villous structures, foci of severe dysplasia or cancer. One of the methods for removing such lesions is the technique of cold loop polypectomy (CLP), i.e. mechanical removal of the polyp with a loop without the use of electric current. This method is common for colon lesions 4-9 mm in size. (For smaller lesions, a technically simple and effective method of removing them using biopsy forceps is most often used) Jung YS, Park JH, Kim HJ et al. Complete biopsy resection of diminutive polyps. Endoscopy 2013; 45: 1024-9). A number of studies have demonstrated the advantages of the CP technique over standard removal methods.

It is also important that the removal of polyps with a cold snare takes less time than with a hot one, averaging 18 min. versus 25 min. (Ichise Y1, Horiuchi A, Nakayama Y, Tanaka N.

However, there are currently clearly not enough large multicenter prospective randomized studies devoted to the comparison of the efficacy and safety of ""standard"" and cold polypectomy.

The opinion of specialists is also ambiguous regarding the instrumentation that should be used for endoscopic removal of small formations. Some endoscopists believe that the type of polypectomy snare used does not affect the efficacy, completeness and safety of removal of small formations, while others, on the contrary, pay special attention to the use of specially designed small-diameter snare loops, believing that only they are capable of ensuring the removal of formations in a single block in the vast majority of cases.

NCT07041242,"Outcomes and Complication Rates of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using the ""Over-the-top"" Technique Combined With Lateral Extra-articular Tenodesis in Patients Over 50 Years Old, Compared With a Control Group of Patients Under 30",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07041242,ACL_50_YO,RECRUITING,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the main stabilizers of the knee, and its injury is among the most common soft tissue injuries of the knee. Surgical reconstruction of the ACL can be performed using various techniques and different types of tissue grafts, including both autografts and allografts.

Although ACL reconstruction is a widely performed surgical procedure in young and physically active individuals-typically patients under 30 years of age-to promote return to sports and prevent early onset of osteoarthritic degeneration, the surgical approach has historically been less common in patients over the age of 50. This is largely due to the lower functional demands typically observed in older patients.

However, with increasing life expectancy and a corresponding rise in functional demands among older individuals, the surgical approach to ACL reconstruction has been progressively reconsidered in the over-50 population. Several recent studies have aimed to evaluate the outcomes of ACL reconstruction in older adults, showing promising results in terms of both recurrence rates and complication rates.

At the II Clinic of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, under the direction of Professor Zaffagnini, the preferred technique for ACL reconstruction is the ""single-bundle over-the-top technique using gracilis and semitendinosus tendons, combined with a lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET)."" LET is an additional surgical step performed alongside ACL reconstruction, which has shown excellent results, especially in young patients at high risk of reinjury. Specifically, clinical data have shown that adding LET to ACL reconstruction can reduce the failure rate by approximately 30%, significantly improve knee stability, and enable a faster return to sports-all without increasing the rate of complications compared to the standard isolated ACL reconstruction technique.

Given these encouraging results in terms of safety and reduced failure rates, the combined ACL + LET procedure has historically been used at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute for all patients, including those over 50 years of age.

The consistent use of this technique allows for the creation of a homogeneous patient cohort, all treated with the same surgical approach. This also enables the formation of two comparable patient groups-one over 50 and one under 30-both treated with the same technique, allowing for a meaningful comparison of primary and secondary endpoints.

While several studies have aimed to compare ACL reconstruction outcomes in older populations with those in younger cohorts, to date, there are no studies in the literature that specifically assess the outcomes and complication rates of ACL reconstruction using the over-the-top technique combined with LET in patients over 50, and compare them with those of younger patients undergoing the same surgical procedure.

Given the growing demand for ACL reconstruction in older patients, we believe it is important to evaluate outcomes in patients over 50 and compare them with a younger cohort, to determine whether the over-the-top + LET technique may be a valid therapeutic option not only for young patients but also for older adults.

Of particular interest is the assessment of the reduced risk of failure and complication rate of the ACL + LET technique performed in over-50 patients, to determine whether the excellent clinical outcomes observed in younger individuals are also confirmed in an older population.",NO,ACL|LET|Hamstring Muscles,"PROCEDURE: ligament reconstruction using the single-bundle ""over-the-top"" technique","Complications, Any complications and subsequent procedures will be documented and recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF).

The self-administered KOOS evaluates five domains: pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreational function, and knee-related quality of life.

KOOS meets core standards for outcome measures and can be used to monitor the progression of knee injury and the effectiveness of treatment. The KOOS questionnaire includes five dimensions relevant to patients: pain, symptoms, daily living activities, sports and recreational activities, and quality of life.

This scale will also be used to assess both preoperative and postoperative pain in the lateral compartment of the knee. The data will help evaluate the onset of pain following surgery, specifically in the area where metal staples are placed for graft fixation during the lateral extra-articular tenodesis procedure.

There are a number of aspects that cause additional complications during mucosectomy, such as convergence of folds, localization of large polyps between two folds, tumor spread beyond two folds, which are factors in tumor fragmentation and require additional study of their impact on long-term treatment outcomes. It is important to note that removal of colon tumors by fragmentation technique is associated with increased recurrence rate, however, in most cases these recurrent lesions are small in size and can be easily removed during dynamic colonoscopy. Predictably high recurrence rate during tumor fragmentation during removal indicates non-radical nature of the intervention performed and safety of this manipulation should be proven. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a relatively new method for removing superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms and was described at the end of the 20th century \[85\]. The development of the submucosal dissection technique was motivated by the difficulty of removing formations larger than 20 mm in a single block by endoscopic resection of the mucosa. Also, the association of tumor fragmentation during resection with a high risk of local recurrence and the difficulty of morphological evaluation of the removed specimen \[133, 136, 190\]. However, endoscopic submucosal dissection is a lengthy and energy-consuming procedure. According to Japanese authors, the average time for endoscopic submucosal dissection is 48.5-60 min. \[77, 89\], and, according to European scientists, the time for performing such interventions ranges from 142 to 176 minutes \[7, 78, 144, 187\]. According to Japanese clinical guidelines, the preferred method for removing large epithelial neoplasms of the colon with suspected intramucosal invasion is ESD, and European and American guidelines talk about the possible use of EMR, including in parts. In addition, unlike Japanese guidelines, where it is considered unsafe to remove a neoplasm in parts in assessing its radicality, Western guidelines allow the use of EMR in parts. Thus, endoscopic resection of the mucous membrane and endoscopic dissection in the submucosal layer are currently successfully used in the treatment of epithelial formations, but the advantages and disadvantages of each technique for a particular type of neoplasm, its histological nature and localization require systematization and clarification. The place of endoscopic mucosal resection and submucosal dissection in the removal of epithelial lesions of the colon has not been definitively established. Technical aspects, risk factors for complications, and long-term results of these types of endoscopic interventions require additional analysis.

Endoscopic interventions on the colon are accompanied by a certain percentage of complications. The most common complications of endoscopic removal of colon neoplasms are bleeding and perforation, the frequency of which varies from 0.08% to 10% depending on the analyzed method and patient sample \[93, 120\]. Given the wide variability of the available data, the influence of various factors on the frequency of complications requires additional study due to the need to identify correctable variables.

In June 2022, a group of authors proposed to the world community of specialists a new classification of complications in endoluminal endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract for standardized assessment and analysis of the safety of endoscopic interventions \[1\] - ""AGREE"" (acronym for Adverse events GastRointEstinal Endoscopy) The authors of the classification also recommend recording any complications that arise, both at the stage of preparation for the planned endoscopic intervention (regardless of whether it was ultimately performed or not), and in those30 days after the intervention.\[1\]. It is these provisions of the AGREE classification that remain controversial and require more careful discussion \[3\]. In any case, in our opinion, at least a cause-and-effect relationship should be established between the action and the complication.",NO,Benign Colon Tumors,PROCEDURE: EMR|PROCEDURE: ESD,"Radicality of removal, Based on the pathomorphological report, the radicality of the removal of the epithelial formation by the EMR and ESD methods will be assessed.

Most people with RSV infection get better by themselves but babies and younger children can become very poorly. About 1 in 15 infants with confirmed RSV within the first 12 months of life will be hospitalised, and a very small proportion will be seriously ill and may die.

Currently there are two different prevention options that can be used to prevent RSV infection in babies. One is a vaccine given to the mother during pregnancy, and the other is a monoclonal antibody given by injection to the baby. Although both prevention options work well on their own and are safe, neither provides 100% protection to the infant. It is not known whether giving both medicines, one to the mother in pregnancy and one to the infant, would provide better protection than giving only one medicine - this is what the PIPELINE-RSV study will look at.

PIPELINE-RSV-International will recruit about 1500 pregnant women from across Europe in UK, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium. A parallel trial, PIPELINE-RSV-France, running in France will recruit about 1000 pregnant women in France; the protocols will align on key aspects and the data will be analysed together. The study will include three study groups with different prevention options used in each: (1) a vaccine given to the mother in pregnancy, (2) an injection given to the baby at the beginning of RSV season, or (3) both a vaccine given to the mother in pregnancy and an injection given to the baby at around 4 months of age. Each mother-baby pair will be randomly allocated to group by a computer. The numbers of babies in each of these groups who acquire RSV will be compared. In some countries only two of the three study groups may be available.

Pregnant women and their babies will be followed until the baby reaches 12 months of age. Information will be collected about medically-important side effects either the mother or the baby had from their medicine(s) and any symptoms of RSV the baby had. Visits with the mother and baby will occur at birth, and 4 and 12 months later; these will ideally be in-person at birth and at 12 months. The mother will complete questionnaires via a Web-based platform to report any non-routine in-person visits, once in pregnancy and after the baby is born twice a month or monthly (more often in the winter), to also report baby's symptoms, to report their trial experience when the baby is 4 and 12 months' old, and to provide their views on vaccination at birth, and when the baby is 4 and 12 months' old. If the baby develops symptoms that might be RSV, their mother or another caregiver will be asked to take a sample using a swab from the baby's nose or mouth, and to send it by post for testing to find out if the baby has RSV.

As well as the main research study, there are also some substudies. A questionnaire will be given to women who consent to take part, to find out their motivations for joining the study and how they prefer to receive information about taking part in studies. A small number of women will be asked to take part in a study to look at how mothers' and babies' immune systems respond to the two different study prevention options , and to investigate different ways of collecting samples from their babies. In addition, researchers will use data from the study to see whether giving both medicines is cost-effective compared with giving just one medicine.

One common practice is to have an ""office catheter removal."" This means, if a patient has trouble urinating after surgery and goes home with a foley catheter, they usually have to come back to the clinic within 2-3 days to have the catheter removed and to do a test to see if they can urinate on their own. For some patients, coming back to the clinic so soon after surgery can be difficult, especially for those patients who live far away or are dependent on others for getting to appointments.

A second, less common, practice is to have patients remove their own catheter at home, or ""self-removal of urinary (Foley) catheter."" With self-removal, patients remove their Foley catheter at home, and confirm that they are urinating normally. This approach has been shown to be safe, with similar patient satisfactions, and success, but those studies did not take into account situations where patients may live a rural area and/or travel a long distance to the medical center to receive care.

Due to lack of resources and an increasingly heavy burden placed on the primary care system, most of heart failure (HF) patients don´t receive a swift follow-up according to guideline recommendations. Our study aims to investigate if a structured and swift follow-up at a dedicated internal medicine HF out-patient clinic (IM-HF)) for older adults with HF post hospital discharge, can improve the quality of life and reduce mortality and re-hospitalization compared to current standard with follow-up within the primary care.

Data and method:

The study will be performed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) at two sites. All patients older than 70 years admitted to a ward with new onset or chronic HF will be invited to participate. After discharge, all patients will be invited to a re-visit to the IM-HF within 2 weeks, and will thereafter be randomized to either continued follow-up on-demand at the IM-HF or within the primary care. Outcomes will be self-reported quality of life, number of days alive and out of hospital, time to death or re-hospitalization and adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy. Data collection will be performed by means of nurse-led interviews, blood sampling and review of medical records. By employing a RCT-design with a well-defined population, intervention, control and outcome, this study aims to provide high-quality evidence that could influence clinical practice.

Societal relevance and utilization:

The study is expected to give valuable insight into the effects of early and structured follow-up for older adults with HF and could improve the standard of care and lead to improved quality of life and reduced risks of re-hospitalization and mortality. Through multidisciplinary teams and cooperation with patients associations the study aspires to be evidence based and patient centered. The start-up and implementation of the study is expected during the following years and may have important implications for the care of older adults with HF.

Plan for project realization:

The study aims to start at the IM-HF at two sites in 2025 with a research nurse with a 50% position at each site. About 12 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are discharged from the hospital wards each week and we expect an inclusion rate of 4 patients/week.

These diseases are refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapies. They typically occur in childhood, although disease onset in adulthood has been observed. The clinical spectrum is wide and mainly involves the central nervous system. Joint involvement is also common, and more rarely, haematological features such as cytopenias or immunodeficiency may be observed.

Nearly all patients show consistent over-activation of the type I IFN pathway, as evidenced, the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, the so-called 'interferon signature'. To date, the natural history of interferonopathies remains unclear.

In this context, the establishment of a natural history of type I interferonopathy in patients is proposed to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and identify biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and disease activity, with the aim of better characterising the diversity of interferonopathies.

The main objective is to characterise the evolution of the pathology in paediatric and adult patients with type I interferonopathies.

NCT07040761,Medical Literacy in TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07040761,LitterAIT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"There are around 30,000 TIAs (transient ischemic attacks) per year in France. This pathology can be the warning sign of a stroke, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality at the population level.

An important part of patient care is to teach them to recognize the symptoms suggestive of a stroke as well as the contributing factors, thus improving the medical literacy of patients.

The results of studies that have assessed medical literacy in France and Europe converge towards a rather low level.

Some studies have focused on stroke literacy in France. They show good knowledge of risk factors and the attitude to adopt in the event of a stroke, but recognition of symptoms remains problematic.

There is very little literature concerning knowledge of TIA in the general population and there are no studies concerning literacy in a population having presented with TIA.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the knowledge of patients who have presented with a TIA (and therefore at high cardiovascular risk) about this disease (risk factors, symptoms, severity, attitude to adopt in the event of symptoms), after their visit to the emergency room.

The objective of the study is to assess whether the addition of OPM-101 will resensitisze the tumour to the anti-PD-1-based treatment.

Potential patients will be screened for this study during the period between initial evidence of disease progression on anti-PD-1 treatment and the required radiographic confirmation of disease progression. The intent is to initiate treatment with OPM-101 once the suspicion of disease progression on anti-PD-1-based therapy is confirmed, and the patient has signed the study Information and Consent Form. No anti-PD-1-based treatment should be administered within 4 weeks prior to study treatment initiation.

In the dose escalation part (Phase 1b) of the study, two different doses of OPM-101 will be evaluated (75 mg bid and 150 mg bid) in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients will receive the dose and regimen of pembrolizumab, as per the authorised product SmPC, in sequential cohorts using a 3 + 3 design, escalating if 0 of 3 (or 1 of 6) patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 6 weeks of treatment and not escalating if 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT.

The RP2D of OPM-101 for the second part of the study (Phase 2a) in combination with pembrolizumab will be based on the rate of DLTs, incidence and severity of Treatment-Related AEs (AEs) and SAEs, and frequency of dose holds, reductions and discontinuations.

There are three core problems with the currently recommended total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) in the guidelines: the lack of evidence-based consensus on the timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the undefined number of chemotherapy cycles, and the uncertainty in the selection of the precise radiotherapy mode. In recent years, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as the core and the TNT regimen has shown a trend of further enhancing tumor regression, providing a possibility for the organ function preservation of rectal cancer. However, existing clinical studies exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity in treatment strategies. In particular, there is a lack of high-quality evidence-based medical evidence in core aspects such as the timing of ICIs intervention and the combination of treatment regimens. This study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled phase II study. The ""pick the winner"" strategy for screening the optimal regimen is adopted to evaluate the efficacy of four neoadjuvant regimens (Group SCRT-4: short-course radiotherapy → 4 cycles of chemotherapy + ICIs; Group SCRT-6: short-course radiotherapy → 6 cycles of chemotherapy + ICIs; Group LCRT-4: concurrent chemoradiotherapy → 4 cycles of chemotherapy + ICIs; Group LCRT-6: concurrent chemoradiotherapy → 6 cycles of chemotherapy + ICIs).

In CV diseases, it has been shown that education and motivation provided under the leadership of nurses are effective in preventing the disease. This success stems from the nurse's holistic approach to the individual and determination of individual-specific needs. It is important for nurses, who are seen as a source of support by the society, to identify empowerment in CV patients and to support patients for independent living. kigai is a well-known term in Japan. This term is sometimes translated as 'purpose in life' and sometimes it can be defined as 'joy of life'. When Ikigai is mentioned, both the source of Ikigai within the individual or the object of Ikigai, and the psychological/emotional state (Ikigai-kan) in which Ikigai is felt come to mind. Accordingly, 'Ikigai' can be defined as the source or object of the purpose/joy of life, and 'Ikigai-kan' as the psychological/emotional state in which these are felt. In addition to the ways in which individuals with cardiovascular disease manage their disease, take precautions against risk factors, and perform strengthening exercises, determining the patients' current state of mind is also an important element. In this sense, physicians and nurses in the clinic take these elements into consideration when planning the care to be provided to patients.

No study has been found in the literature to date that evaluates the relationship between CAH strengthening and Ikigia. Based on this information, this study aims to examine the relationship between CAH strengthening and Ikigai.

NCT07039994,Early Palliative Care in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer Using an e-Health Ecosystem,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07039994,AIRPAL,RECRUITING,"Palliative care has long been associated primarily with end-of-life support. However, its scope is much broader. As highlighted in the Hastings Center Report, the purposes of medicine include not only curing disease but also preventing illness, relieving suffering, caring for patients, avoiding preventable deaths, and ensuring a peaceful death when unavoidable. Palliative care plays a vital role in achieving all of these goals. In addition to pain and symptom management, it addresses the prevention of complicated grief, the emergence of severe symptoms (e.g., constipation, delirium), the inappropriate use of end-of-life treatments, and offers specialized care for incurable diseases.

This model of care follows a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach, focusing on the person beyond the illness and addressing emotional, social, spiritual, and practical needs. Recent studies have shown that early integration of palliative care within routine oncology improves symptom control, emotional well-being, and coping with the illness. Furthermore, it enhances quality of life for both patients and their families, reduces healthcare resource usage, and does not increase overall health expenditure.

Such early integration also facilitates discussions about end-of-life issues, promotes advance care planning, and supports improved home-based palliative care. Additionally, it has been associated with fewer aggressive treatments and a positive impact on patient survival.

Systematic symptom assessment leads to earlier and more effective management. In this context, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have shown promise in enabling remote monitoring and care delivery. These tools can enhance quality of life, improve treatment adherence, reduce emergency visits, and positively influence survival. However, existing studies have limitations, such as small sample sizes and lack of evaluator blinding.

The COVID-19 pandemic emphasized the need for physical distancing and accelerated the development of remote healthcare systems. Some specialized cancer centers, like the Institut Català d'Oncologia, have implemented functional multidisciplinary units for each cancer type. These units consist of various specialists (medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, advanced practice nurses, palliative care professionals, etc.) who collaboratively decide the best course of treatment. A key role within these units is the reference nurse, assigned to each patient, who acts as a main point of contact, available for in-person or phone consultations.

One major improvement in recent years has been the integration of palliative care clinics within oncology departments. Best practices now emphasize early palliative intervention based on patient complexity and needs. While no universal definition exists, most studies define ""early palliative care"" as involvement by a palliative team within the first three months following a diagnosis of advanced cancer. This approach is supported by multiple scientific societies. Nevertheless, challenges such as limited resources, accessibility barriers, and increasing in-person demand near the end of life remain significant obstacles.

Among advanced cancers, lung cancer stands out due to its high prevalence and poor prognosis. It is characterized by frequent and unpredictable symptoms, requiring flexible and responsive follow-up. Adapting care to patients' changing needs could improve quality of life, optimize resources, and reduce the frequency of in-person visits.

This study proposes the integration of early palliative care with an e-Health ecosystem, reflecting the global push to bring care into the homes of vulnerable patients using modern technology. Evidence for the impact of ICTs in palliative care remains limited, and existing studies are generally of low quality. To date, only one registered trial (NCT03375489) has explored e-Health in early palliative care. Unlike that study, this research offers a scalable model tailored to patient complexity, alongside a comprehensive cost-utility evaluation (e.g., fewer in-person visits, emergency care use, and patient transfers to care centers).

This is the first international clinical trial of its kind in palliative care. It is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with blinded third-party evaluation.

The study will also learn about the safety of using a higher dose.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does a higher radiation dose lead to fewer treatment failures (meaning the tumor growing back or causing serious side effects) one year after treatment? What are the side effects associated with the high dose compared to the standard dose? How does each radiation dose affect a patient's pain and quality of life?

Researchers will randomly assign participants (like a coin toss) to one of two groups to compare the outcomes:

The Standard Dose Group: Will receive a single radiation treatment of 16 Gy. The High Dose Group: Will receive a single, more powerful radiation treatment of 20 Gy.

Participants in this study will:

Receive a single, one-time, highly-focused radiation treatment (SSRS) to the spinal tumor.

Each hospital will include two ICUs, randomized to either the intervention or control group for six months, followed by a crossover. The intervention group will receive daily bathing using no-rinse, 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-impregnated washcloths along with antimicrobial and PPI stewardship focused on reducing unnecessary carbapenem and PPI use. The control group will receive standard bathing without chlorhexidine, while receiving the same stewardship interventions as the intervention group.

Primary outcomes include the incidence and prevalence of CPE colonization and CPE-attributable healthcare-associated infections such as bloodstream infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and urinary tract infections. Secondary outcomes include evaluation of residual CHG skin concentrations, comparison with CHG minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CPE isolates, impact of feedback on adherence to bathing protocols, and assessment of adverse skin reactions to CHG bathing.
